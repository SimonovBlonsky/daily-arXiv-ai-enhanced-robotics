TL;DR: DeFM是一个专门为机器人应用设计的自监督深度图像基础模型，使用60M深度图像数据集和DINO风格的自蒸馏目标训练，在多种深度感知任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度传感器在机器人平台中广泛应用，但深度模态的表征学习相比RGB模态仍未被充分探索，缺乏专门针对深度图像的大规模基础模型。

Method: 1. 使用DINO风格的自蒸馏目标在60M深度图像数据集上训练；2. 引入新颖的输入归一化策略以保持跨多尺度的度量感知；3. 将DeFM蒸馏为适合资源受限机器人系统的紧凑模型。

Result: DeFM在深度分类、分割、导航、运动、操作等基准测试中达到最先进性能，并展示了从仿真到真实环境的强泛化能力，无需任务特定微调即可使用。

Conclusion: DeFM填补了深度模态基础模型的空白，为机器人应用提供了可直接使用的预训练模型，促进了深度感知在机器人学习中的发展。

Abstract: Depth sensors are widely deployed across robotic platforms, and advances in fast, high-fidelity depth simulation have enabled robotic policies trained on depth observations to achieve robust sim-to-real transfer for a wide range of tasks. Despite this, representation learning for depth modality remains underexplored compared to RGB, where large-scale foundation models now define the state of the art. To address this gap, we present DeFM, a self-supervised foundation model trained entirely on depth images for robotic applications. Using a DINO-style self-distillation objective on a curated dataset of 60M depth images, DeFM learns geometric and semantic representations that generalize to diverse environments, tasks, and sensors. To retain metric awareness across multiple scales, we introduce a novel input normalization strategy. We further distill DeFM into compact models suitable for resource-constrained robotic systems. When evaluated on depth-based classification, segmentation, navigation, locomotion, and manipulation benchmarks, DeFM achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates strong generalization from simulation to real-world environments. We release all our pretrained models, which can be adopted off-the-shelf for depth-based robotic learning without task-specific fine-tuning. Webpage: https://de-fm.github.io/

TL;DR: Sprout是一个面向开发者的人类机器人平台，强调安全性、表现力和易用性，旨在解决现有机器人难以在人类环境中安全长期部署的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管学习控制、大规模模拟和生成模型取得了进展，但机器人领域仍缺乏适合在人类环境中安全、长期部署的平台。现有的人形机器人要么是封闭的工业系统，要么是难以在人类周围部署和操作的学术原型，这限制了机器人技术的发展。

Method: Sprout采用轻量化设计，具有柔顺控制、有限关节扭矩和柔软外壳以确保安全；集成了全身控制、内置夹爪操作和基于VR的遥操作；配备富有表现力的头部支持社交互动；提供统一的硬件-软件堆栈。

Result: Sprout平台通过降低物理和技术部署门槛，扩展了有能力的人形机器人平台的访问范围，为在真实人类环境中开发具身智能提供了实用基础。

Conclusion: Sprout作为一个开发者平台，通过强调安全性、表现力和开发者可访问性，解决了现有机器人难以在人类环境中部署的问题，为人形机器人在真实世界中的研究和应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent advances in learned control, large-scale simulation, and generative models have accelerated progress toward general-purpose robotic controllers, yet the field still lacks platforms suitable for safe, expressive, long-term deployment in human environments. Most existing humanoids are either closed industrial systems or academic prototypes that are difficult to deploy and operate around people, limiting progress in robotics. We introduce Sprout, a developer platform designed to address these limitations through an emphasis on safety, expressivity, and developer accessibility. Sprout adopts a lightweight form factor with compliant control, limited joint torques, and soft exteriors to support safe operation in shared human spaces. The platform integrates whole-body control, manipulation with integrated grippers, and virtual-reality-based teleoperation within a unified hardware-software stack. An expressive head further enables social interaction -- a domain that remains underexplored on most utilitarian humanoids. By lowering physical and technical barriers to deployment, Sprout expands access to capable humanoid platforms and provides a practical basis for developing embodied intelligence in real human environments.

*Ioannis G. Polyzos,Konstantinos J. Kyriakopoulos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种切换非线性模型预测控制策略，用于水下车辆-机械臂系统的安全碰撞处理，包括避免碰撞和利用机械臂推离障碍物


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下环境中自主车辆在执行干预任务时可能面临碰撞风险，需要安全处理策略来保护车辆敏感区域

Method: 采用切换非线性模型预测控制策略，当无法避免碰撞时，利用机械臂推压障碍物以偏转离开碰撞

Result: 虚拟实验表明算法能成功检测碰撞，并能避免碰撞或适当使用机械臂处理碰撞而不损坏车辆敏感区域

Conclusion: 提出的切换NMPC策略能有效处理水下车辆-机械臂系统的碰撞情况，提高水下干预任务的安全性

Abstract: For active intervention tasks in underwater environments, the use of autonomous vehicles is just now emerging as an active area of research. During operation, for various reasons, the robot might find itself on a collision course with an obstacle in its environment. In this paper, a switching Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy is proposed to safely handle collisions for an Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS). When avoiding the collision is impossible, the control algorithm takes advantage of the manipulator, using it to push against the obstacle, and deflect away from the collision. Virtual experiments are performed to demonstrate the algorithm's capability to successfully detect collisions and either avoid them, or use the manipulator to handle them appropriately without damaging sensitive areas of the vehicle.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于神经形态事件触觉传感器Evetac的连续盲文识别系统，实现高精度实时识别，模拟人类手指滑动扫描策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统盲文阅读器依赖离散字符扫描，限制阅读速度；基于视觉的方法计算量大、延迟高、在真实环境中性能下降

Method: 使用开源神经形态事件触觉传感器Evetac，结合时空分割和轻量级ResNet分类器处理稀疏事件流，实现连续滑动识别

Result: 在标准深度下达到接近完美准确率(>=98%)，支持多种盲文板布局，快速扫描下保持强性能，在实际盲文板上词级准确率超过90%

Conclusion: 神经形态触觉感知为机器人盲文阅读提供了可扩展、低延迟的解决方案，对辅助技术和机器人应用的触觉感知有更广泛意义

Abstract: Conventional robotic Braille readers typically rely on discrete, character-by-character scanning, limiting reading speed and disrupting natural flow. Vision-based alternatives often require substantial computation, introduce latency, and degrade in real-world conditions. In this work, we present a high accuracy, real-time pipeline for continuous Braille recognition using Evetac, an open-source neuromorphic event-based tactile sensor. Unlike frame-based vision systems, the neuromorphic tactile modality directly encodes dynamic contact events during continuous sliding, closely emulating human finger-scanning strategies. Our approach combines spatiotemporal segmentation with a lightweight ResNet-based classifier to process sparse event streams, enabling robust character recognition across varying indentation depths and scanning speeds. The proposed system achieves near-perfect accuracy (>=98%) at standard depths, generalizes across multiple Braille board layouts, and maintains strong performance under fast scanning. On a physical Braille board containing daily-living vocabulary, the system attains over 90% word-level accuracy, demonstrating robustness to temporal compression effects that challenge conventional methods. These results position neuromorphic tactile sensing as a scalable, low latency solution for robotic Braille reading, with broader implications for tactile perception in assistive and robotic applications.

### [5] [SimTO: A simulation-based topology optimization framework for bespoke soft robotic grippers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19098)
*Kurt Enkera,Josh Pinskier,Marcus Gallagher,David Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimTO框架通过从物理模拟器中自动提取负载案例，实现高分辨率拓扑优化，为特征丰富物体生成定制化软体夹持器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软体夹持器难以抓取具有高拓扑变异性的特征丰富物体（如齿轮、珊瑚、西兰花等），这些物体缺乏明确的"最优"接触表面，容易受损。传统拓扑优化需要预定义负载案例，但软体夹持器与特征丰富物体交互时会产生数百种不可预测的接触力，这些负载无法预先确定。

Method: 提出SimTO框架，通过从基于接触的物理模拟器中自动提取负载案例，消除手动负载规范的需求，实现高分辨率拓扑优化。给定任意特征丰富物体，SimTO生成高度定制的软体夹持器，具有与物体几何形状相匹配的细粒度形态特征。

Result: 数值结果显示，SimTO设计的夹持器不仅对特征丰富物体具有高度专化性，还能泛化到未见过的物体。

Conclusion: SimTO框架通过自动从物理模拟中提取负载案例，克服了传统拓扑优化需要预定义负载的限制，为特征丰富物体生成高度定制化的软体夹持器，解决了现有夹持器难以安全抓取复杂几何形状物体的挑战。

Abstract: Soft robotic grippers are essential for grasping delicate, geometrically complex objects in manufacturing, healthcare and agriculture. However, existing grippers struggle to grasp feature-rich objects with high topological variability, including gears with sharp tooth profiles on automotive assembly lines, corals with fragile protrusions, or vegetables with irregular branching structures like broccoli. Unlike simple geometric primitives such as cubes or spheres, feature-rich objects lack a clear "optimal" contact surface, making them both difficult to grasp and susceptible to damage when grasped by existing gripper designs. Safe handling of such objects therefore requires specialized soft grippers whose morphology is tailored to the object's features. Topology optimization offers a promising approach for producing specialized grippers, but its utility is limited by the requirement for pre-defined load cases. For soft grippers interacting with feature-rich objects, these loads arise from hundreds of unpredictable gripper-object contact forces during grasping and are unknown a priori. To address this problem, we introduce SimTO, a framework that enables high-resolution topology optimization by automatically extracting load cases from a contact-based physics simulator, eliminating the need for manual load specification. Given an arbitrary feature-rich object, SimTO produces highly customized soft grippers with fine-grained morphological features tailored to the object geometry. Numerical results show our designs are not only highly specialized to feature-rich objects, but also generalize to unseen objects.

### [6] [Agree to Disagree: Consensus-Free Flocking under Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19119)
*Peter Travis Jardine,Sidney Givigi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的群体控制方法，允许智能体协商不同的期望距离参数，无需全局信息或通信，适用于目标冲突的半信任场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统群体控制假设智能体具有统一的期望距离，但实际应用中智能体类型和配置多样化，且经常在没有信任保证或安全通信的环境下工作，需要更灵活的控制框架。

Method: 通过引入一种新的约束集体势函数，允许智能体协商距离参数，仅通过局部观察实现，无需全局信息或智能体间通信。

Result: 通过一系列仿真验证了方法的有效性，该方法能够处理相邻智能体追求冲突目标的半信任场景。

Conclusion: 提出的方法扩展了传统群体控制框架，使其能够适应多样化的智能体配置和半信任环境，为多智能体系统提供了更灵活、鲁棒的控制方案。

Abstract: Robots sometimes have to work together with a mixture of partially-aligned or conflicting goals. Flocking - coordinated motion through cohesion, alignment, and separation - traditionally assumes uniform desired inter-agent distances. Many practical applications demand greater flexibility, as the diversity of types and configurations grows with the popularity of multi-agent systems in society. Moreover, agents often operate without guarantees of trust or secure communication. Motivated by these challenges we update well-established frameworks by relaxing this assumption of shared inter-agent distances and constraints. Through a new form of constrained collective potential function, we introduce a solution that permits negotiation of these parameters. In the spirit of the traditional flocking control canon, this negotiation is achieved purely through local observations and does not require any global information or inter-agent communication. The approach is robust to semi-trust scenarios, where neighbouring agents pursue conflicting goals. We validate the effectiveness of the approach through a series of simulations.

### [7] [Robust Out-of-Order Retrieval for Grid-Based Storage at Maximum Capacity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19144)
*Tzvika Geft,William Zhang,Jingjin Yu,Kostas Bekris*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个框架来改善不确定条件下自动化仓储系统的运行效率，通过k有界扰动模型和网格宽度优化来最小化货物重定位


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际物流应用中，存储序列已知但检索序列可能在存储后发生变化，这种不确定性导致需要货物重定位，影响系统效率

Method: 采用k有界扰动模型，研究网格宽度与消除重定位的关系，提供高效求解器计算鲁棒存储布局，并针对超出k的扰动提出最小化重定位策略

Result: 证明Θ(k)网格宽度对于最大容量下消除重定位是必要且充分的；当k达到网格宽度一半时，基本消除重定位；当k达到完整网格宽度时，重定位减少50%以上

Conclusion: 提出的存储-检索框架能有效处理不确定性，显著减少货物重定位，提高自动化仓储系统的运行效率

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for improving the operational efficiency of automated storage systems under uncertainty. It considers a 2D grid-based storage for uniform-sized loads (e.g., containers, pallets, or totes), which are moved by a robot (or other manipulator) along a collision-free path in the grid. The loads are labeled (i.e., unique) and must be stored in a given sequence, and later be retrieved in a different sequence -- an operational pattern that arises in logistics applications, such as last-mile distribution centers and shipyards. The objective is to minimize the load relocations to ensure efficient retrieval. A previous result guarantees a zero-relocation solution for known storage and retrieval sequences, even for storage at full capacity, provided that the side of the grid through which loads are stored/retrieved is at least 3 cells wide. However, in practice, the retrieval sequence can change after the storage phase. To address such uncertainty, this work investigates \emph{$k$-bounded perturbations} during retrieval, under which any two loads may depart out of order if they are originally at most $k$ positions apart. We prove that a $Θ(k)$ grid width is necessary and sufficient for eliminating relocations at maximum capacity. We also provide an efficient solver for computing a storage arrangement that is robust to such perturbations. To address the higher-uncertainty case where perturbations exceed $k$, a strategy is introduced to effectively minimize relocations. Extensive experiments show that, for $k$ up to half the grid width, the proposed storage-retrieval framework essentially eliminates relocations. For $k$ values up to the full grid width, relocations are reduced by $50\%+$.

TL;DR: 提出TaMeSo-bot系统，结合软腕和触觉记忆实现安全鲁棒的接触式操作，核心是MAT³模型通过掩码预测学习时空表征，在多种孔轴装配任务中优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 触觉记忆对于接触密集型任务（如不确定条件下的钥匙插入）至关重要，需要复制这种能力来实现安全鲁棒的机器人操作

Method: 提出TaMeSo-bot系统：1) 软腕实现安全接触探索；2) 触觉记忆通过检索重用过往演示；3) MAT³模型联合建模机器人动作、分布式触觉反馈、力扭矩测量和本体感觉信号的时空交互，通过掩码标记预测学习丰富表征

Conclusion: TaMeSo-bot系统成功实现了触觉记忆功能，MAT³模型通过掩码预测有效学习时空表征，为不确定条件下的接触式操作提供了安全鲁棒的解决方案

Abstract: Tactile memory, the ability to store and retrieve touch-based experience, is critical for contact-rich tasks such as key insertion under uncertainty. To replicate this capability, we introduce Tactile Memory with Soft Robot (TaMeSo-bot), a system that integrates a soft wrist with tactile retrieval-based control to enable safe and robust manipulation. The soft wrist allows safe contact exploration during data collection, while tactile memory reuses past demonstrations via retrieval for flexible adaptation to unseen scenarios. The core of this system is the Masked Tactile Trajectory Transformer (MAT$^\text{3}$), which jointly models spatiotemporal interactions between robot actions, distributed tactile feedback, force-torque measurements, and proprioceptive signals. Through masked-token prediction, MAT$^\text{3}$ learns rich spatiotemporal representations by inferring missing sensory information from context, autonomously extracting task-relevant features without explicit subtask segmentation. We validate our approach on peg-in-hole tasks with diverse pegs and conditions in real-robot experiments. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that MAT$^\text{3}$ achieves higher success rates than the baselines over all conditions and shows remarkable capability to adapt to unseen pegs and conditions.

*Yimin Tang,Sven Koenig,Erdem Bıyık*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Judgelight是一种后优化方法，通过压缩智能体轨迹中的封闭子路径来减少冗余运动，降低MAPF解决方案成本约20%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的MAPF求解器虽然快速且可扩展，但生成的可行轨迹往往包含不必要的或振荡的运动，不适合实际部署

Method: 提出Judgelight后优化方法，将MAPF-Collapse问题形式化为整数线性规划（ILP）问题，通过压缩智能体轨迹中的封闭子路径来移除冗余运动

Result: 实验结果显示Judgelight能持续减少约20%的解决方案成本，特别是对基于学习的求解器效果显著

Conclusion: Judgelight作为后优化方法能有效提升MAPF轨迹质量，使其更适合实际世界部署，同时证明了MAPF-Collapse问题是NP难的

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is an NP-hard problem with applications in warehouse automation and multi-robot coordination. Learning-based MAPF solvers offer fast and scalable planning but often produce feasible trajectories that contain unnecessary or oscillatory movements. We propose Judgelight, a post-optimization method that improves trajectory quality after a MAPF solver generates a feasible schedule. Judgelight collapses closed subwalks in agents' trajectories to remove redundant movements while preserving all feasibility constraints. We formalize this process as MAPF-Collapse, prove that it is NP-hard, and present an exact optimization approach by formulating it as integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Experimental results show Judgelight consistently reduces solution cost by around 20%, particularly for learning-based solvers, producing trajectories that are better suited for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: SimHum：一种协同训练框架，通过结合仿真机器人动作的动力学先验和真实世界人类观察的视觉先验，解决仿真数据和人类数据各自的局限性，实现数据高效且泛化能力强的机器人操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿真数据和真实人类数据虽然能规避机器人数据收集的高昂成本，但各自存在局限性：仿真数据存在视觉差距（sim-to-real gap），人类数据存在身体差距（human-to-robot embodiment gap）。作者发现这两种数据源具有天然的互补性：仿真提供机器人动作，人类数据提供真实世界观察。

Method: 提出SimHum协同训练框架，同时从仿真机器人动作中提取动力学先验，从真实世界人类观察中提取视觉先验。基于这两种互补的先验，实现数据高效且泛化能力强的真实世界机器人操作。

Result: 在相同数据收集预算下，SimHum比基线方法性能提升高达40%。仅使用80个真实数据，在OOD任务上达到62.5%的成功率，比仅使用真实数据的基线方法高出7.1倍。

Conclusion: 通过利用仿真数据和人类数据的互补优势，SimHum框架能够有效解决各自的数据差距问题，实现数据高效且泛化能力强的机器人操作，为机器人学习提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Synthetic simulation data and real-world human data provide scalable alternatives to circumvent the prohibitive costs of robot data collection. However, these sources suffer from the sim-to-real visual gap and the human-to-robot embodiment gap, respectively, which limits the policy's generalization to real-world scenarios. In this work, we identify a natural yet underexplored complementarity between these sources: simulation offers the robot action that human data lacks, while human data provides the real-world observation that simulation struggles to render. Motivated by this insight, we present SimHum, a co-training framework to simultaneously extract kinematic prior from simulated robot actions and visual prior from real-world human observations. Based on the two complementary priors, we achieve data-efficient and generalizable robotic manipulation in real-world tasks. Empirically, SimHum outperforms the baseline by up to $\mathbf{40\%}$ under the same data collection budget, and achieves a $\mathbf{62.5\%}$ OOD success with only 80 real data, outperforming the real only baseline by $7.1\times$.

TL;DR: TCMP提出任务优先对抗模仿框架，将模仿作为条件正则化而非平等目标，在保持任务性能的同时获得自然运动风格


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类演示的运动先验常因具身差异、重定向误差和任务无关变化而次优或与机器人任务不匹配，导致简单模仿降低任务性能；而纯任务强化学习虽能获得任务最优解，但常产生不自然或不稳定运动

Method: 提出任务中心运动先验(TCMP)，将模仿作为条件正则化而非平等目标，仅在模仿信号与任务进展兼容时纳入模仿信号，产生自适应、几何感知的更新，保持任务可行下降并抑制不对齐时的有害模仿

Result: 通过人形机器人控制实验验证，在噪声演示下实现稳健的任务性能并保持一致的运动风格

Conclusion: TCMP框架解决了线性奖励混合在对抗模仿学习中的基本限制，通过任务优先方法在保持任务性能的同时获得自然运动风格

Abstract: Humanoid control often leverages motion priors from human demonstrations to encourage natural behaviors. However, such demonstrations are frequently suboptimal or misaligned with robotic tasks due to embodiment differences, retargeting errors, and task-irrelevant variations, causing naïve imitation to degrade task performance. Conversely, task-only reinforcement learning admits many task-optimal solutions, often resulting in unnatural or unstable motions. This exposes a fundamental limitation of linear reward mixing in adversarial imitation learning. We propose \emph{Task-Centric Motion Priors} (TCMP), a task-priority adversarial imitation framework that treats imitation as a conditional regularizer rather than a co-equal objective. TCMP maximizes task improvement while incorporating imitation signals only when they are compatible with task progress, yielding an adaptive, geometry-aware update that preserves task-feasible descent and suppresses harmful imitation under misalignment. We provide theoretical analysis of gradient conflict and task-priority stationary points, and validate our claims through humanoid control experiments demonstrating robust task performance with consistent motion style under noisy demonstrations.

Abstract: For lattice modular self-reconfigurable robots (MSRRs), maintaining stable connections during reconfiguration is crucial for physical feasibility and deployability. This letter presents a novel self-reconfiguration planning algorithm for deformable quadrilateral MSRRs that guarantees stable connection. The method first constructs feasible connect/disconnect actions using a virtual graph representation, and then organizes these actions into a valid execution sequence through a Dependence-based Reverse Tree (DRTree) that resolves interdependencies. We also prove that reconfiguration sequences satisfying motion characteristics exist for any pair of configurations with seven or more modules (excluding linear topologies). Finally, comparisons with a modified BiRRT algorithm highlight the superior efficiency and stability of our approach, while deployment on a physical robotic platform confirms its practical feasibility.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合强化学习和李雅普诺夫稳定器的控制框架，为轮式移动机器人在非结构化环境中提供形式化的目标到达保证，将目标到达率从84.6%提升到99.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习虽然能学习目标到达策略，但缺乏形式化保证目标一定能到达。引入屏蔽机制可以提供安全约束，但会限制学习和探索效果。需要一种既能提供形式化保证，又不影响学习效果的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将强化学习与形式化保证相结合，为轮式移动机器人提供了既有效又安全的控制方案，在保持探索能力的同时显著提高了目标到达的可靠性和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can be highly effective at learning goal-reaching policies, but it typically does not provide formal guarantees that the goal will always be reached. A common approach to provide formal goal-reaching guarantees is to introduce a shielding mechanism that restricts the agent to actions that satisfy predefined safety constraints. The main challenge here is integrating this mechanism with RL so that learning and exploration remain effective without becoming overly conservative. Hence, this paper proposes an RL-based control framework that provides formal goal-reaching guarantees for wheeled mobile robots operating in unstructured environments. We first design a real-time RL policy with a set of 15 carefully defined reward terms. These rewards encourage the robot to reach both static and dynamic goals while generating sufficiently smooth command signals that comply with predefined safety specifications, which is critical in practice. Second, a Lyapunov-like stabilizer layer is integrated into the benchmark RL framework as a policy supervisor to formally strengthen the goal-reaching control while preserving meaningful exploration of the state action space. The proposed framework is suitable for real-time deployment in challenging environments, as it provides a formal guarantee of convergence to the intended goal states and compensates for uncertainties by generating real-time control signals based on the current state, while respecting real-world motion constraints. The experimental results show that the proposed Lyapunov-like stabilizer consistently improves the benchmark RL policies, boosting the goal-reaching rate from 84.6% to 99.0%, sharply reducing failures, and improving efficiency.

*Jin Huang,Zichen Liu,Haoda Li,Zhikun Wang,Ying Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进的SINS/DVL水下导航系统方法，通过引入姿态误差感知的DVL速度转换模型和协方差矩阵的方差传播方法，显著提高了长期导航精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SINS/DVL松耦合架构中，使用SINS导出的姿态将DVL速度从机体坐标系投影到导航坐标系时，累积的姿态估计误差会引入速度投影偏差，导致长期运行中导航性能下降。

Method: 1. 提出车辆姿态误差感知的DVL速度转换模型，在观测方程中纳入姿态误差项以减少投影引起的速度偏差；2. 开发基于协方差矩阵的方差传播方法，在坐标系间转换DVL测量不确定性，引入基于期望的姿态误差补偿项实现统计一致的噪声建模。

Result: 仿真和现场实验结果表明：两种改进单独应用都能提高导航精度，证实累积姿态误差同时影响投影速度测量及其相关不确定性；联合应用时能有效抑制长期误差发散。现场实验显示，与基线IMU+DVL方法相比，3D位置RMSE改善78.3%，最大分量位置误差减少71.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过解决姿态误差引起的速度投影偏差和噪声建模不一致问题，为改善长期SINS/DVL导航性能提供了鲁棒的解决方案，显著提高了水下导航系统的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: In underwater navigation systems, strap-down inertial navigation system/Doppler velocity log (SINS/DVL)-based loosely coupled architectures are widely adopted. Conventional approaches project DVL velocities from the body coordinate system to the navigation coordinate system using SINS-derived attitude; however, accumulated attitude estimation errors introduce biases into velocity projection and degrade navigation performance during long-term operation. To address this issue, two complementary improvements are introduced. First, a vehicle attitude error-aware DVL velocity transformation model is formulated by incorporating attitude error terms into the observation equation to reduce projection-induced velocity bias. Second, a covariance matrix-based variance propagation method is developed to transform DVL measurement uncertainty across coordinate systems, introducing an expectation-based attitude error compensation term to achieve statistically consistent noise modeling. Simulation and field experiment results demonstrate that both improvements individually enhance navigation accuracy and confirm that accumulated attitude errors affect both projected velocity measurements and their associated uncertainty. When jointly applied, long-term error divergence is effectively suppressed. Field experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a 78.3% improvement in 3D position RMSE and a 71.8% reduction in the maximum component-wise position error compared with the baseline IMU+DVL method, providing a robust solution for improving long-term SINS/DVL navigation performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PALM通过利用局部动作分布在OOD和演示域之间的不变性，同时处理工作空间偏移、视角变化和跨具身转移等OOD泛化问题，无需额外模态或数据收集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像行为克隆在训练域外的泛化仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常单独处理各个泛化维度（工作空间偏移、视角变化、跨具身转移），依赖复杂流程，且缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: PALM将操作策略模块化为粗粒度全局组件和细粒度局部策略。通过强制局部视觉聚焦和一致的本体感受表示，减少域内和OOD输入在局部策略层的差异，使策略能在OOD条件下检索不变的局部动作。

Result: 实验显示PALM将OOD性能下降限制在模拟环境8%和现实世界24%，而基线方法分别为45%和77%。

Conclusion: PALM利用局部动作分布的不变性，能够同时处理多种OOD偏移，无需额外输入模态、模型修改或数据收集，显著提升了图像行为克隆的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizing beyond the training domain in image-based behavior cloning remains challenging. Existing methods address individual axes of generalization, workspace shifts, viewpoint changes, and cross-embodiment transfer, yet they are typically developed in isolation and often rely on complex pipelines. We introduce PALM (Perception Alignment for Local Manipulation), which leverages the invariance of local action distributions between out-of-distribution (OOD) and demonstrated domains to address these OOD shifts concurrently, without additional input modalities, model changes, or data collection. PALM modularizes the manipulation policy into coarse global components and a local policy for fine-grained actions. We reduce the discrepancy between in-domain and OOD inputs at the local policy level by enforcing local visual focus and consistent proprioceptive representation, allowing the policy to retrieve invariant local actions under OOD conditions. Experiments show that PALM limits OOD performance drops to 8% in simulation and 24% in the real world, compared to 45% and 77% for baselines.

Conclusion: Rhombot通过简化设计和最小化控制复杂度，实现了模块化自重构机器人的基本功能，其独特的运动学特性支持连续稳定的重构过程，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Rhombot, a novel deformable planar lattice modular self-reconfigurable robot (MSRR) with a rhombus shaped module. Each module consists of a parallelogram skeleton with a single centrally mounted actuator that enables folding and unfolding along its diagonal. The core design philosophy is to achieve essential MSRR functionalities such as morphing, docking, and locomotion with minimal control complexity. This enables a continuous and stable reconfiguration process that is independent of the surrounding medium, allowing the system to reliably form various configurations in diverse environments. To leverage the unique kinematics of Rhombot, we introduce morphpivoting, a novel motion primitive for reconfiguration that differs from advanced MSRR systems, and propose a strategy for its continuous execution. Finally, a series of physical experiments validate the module's stable reconfiguration ability, as well as its positional and docking accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统逆透视映射在矢量化道路制图中存在映射误差、共面性假设限制以及精度不足等问题，需要一种低成本、高精度的解决方案。

Method: 使用Catmull-Rom样条表征车道线，多边形统一描绘其他地面标记；通过实例分割结果优化样条控制点和多边形角点的三维位置；同时优化IPM单应矩阵和车辆位姿。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了IPM在矢量化道路制图中的局限性，提供了一种低成本、高精度的解决方案，能够泛化处理所有常见地面标记和车道线。

Abstract: In this study, we present a low-cost and unified framework for vectorized road mapping leveraging enhanced inverse perspective mapping (IPM). In this framework, Catmull-Rom splines are utilized to characterize lane lines, and all the other ground markings are depicted using polygons uniformly. The results from instance segmentation serve as references to refine the three-dimensional position of spline control points and polygon corner points. In conjunction with this process, the homography matrix of IPM and vehicle poses are optimized simultaneously. Our proposed framework significantly reduces the mapping errors associated with IPM. It also improves the accuracy of the initial IPM homography matrix and the predicted vehicle poses. Furthermore, it addresses the limitations imposed by the coplanarity assumption in IPM. These enhancements enable IPM to be effectively applied to vectorized road mapping, which serves a cost-effective solution with enhanced accuracy. In addition, our framework generalizes road map elements to include all common ground markings and lane lines. The proposed framework is evaluated in two different practical scenarios, and the test results show that our method can automatically generate high-precision maps with near-centimeter-level accuracy. Importantly, the optimized IPM matrix achieves an accuracy comparable to that of manual calibration, while the accuracy of vehicle poses is also significantly improved.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将推荐系统技术整合到社交机器人中，以解决现有方法在全面捕捉用户偏好方面的不足，并实现更有效的个性化交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交机器人个性化方法（如大语言模型和强化学习）无法全面捕捉用户的长短期偏好和细粒度特征，也不能有效进行动作排序选择、主动个性化以及确保伦理负责任的适应。需要更系统的方法来建模用户偏好并提供个性化推荐。

Conclusion: 推荐系统技术能有效解决社交机器人个性化中的关键挑战，提出的模块化整合框架不仅提升了机器人个性化能力，还促进了跨领域合作与创新。

Abstract: Personalization in social robots refers to the ability of the robot to meet the needs and/or preferences of an individual user. Existing approaches typically rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate context-aware responses based on user metadata and historical interactions or on adaptive methods such as reinforcement learning (RL) to learn from users' immediate reactions in real time. However, these approaches fall short of comprehensively capturing user preferences-including long-term, short-term, and fine-grained aspects-, and of using them to rank and select actions, proactively personalize interactions, and ensure ethically responsible adaptations. To address the limitations, we propose drawing on recommender systems (RSs), which specialize in modeling user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. To ensure the integration of RS techniques is well-grounded and seamless throughout the social robot pipeline, we (i) align the paradigms underlying social robots and RSs, (ii) identify key techniques that can enhance personalization in social robots, and (iii) design them as modular, plug-and-play components. This work not only establishes a framework for integrating RS techniques into social robots but also opens a pathway for deep collaboration between the RS and HRI communities, accelerating innovation in both fields.

Method: 采用混合方法研究（N=201），参与者观看不同拟人化程度机器人（蜘蛛型、双足型、人形）受物理虐待的视频，完成道德基础、愤怒和社会距离测量，并进行定性分析。

Result: 拟人化程度决定人们是否将道德关怀延伸至机器人，而道德基础塑造他们对此类关怀的推理方式。定性分析显示低进步主义个体采用基于性格的判断，高进步主义个体进行未来导向的道德审议。

Conclusion: 研究结果为机器人设计和政策沟通提供启示，表明拟人化是道德关怀的关键决定因素，道德基础影响关怀推理方式。

Abstract: As robots become increasingly integrated into daily life, understanding responses to robot mistreatment carries important ethical and design implications. This mixed-methods study (N = 201) examined how anthropomorphic levels and moral foundations shape reactions to robot abuse. Participants viewed videos depicting physical mistreatment of robots varying in humanness (Spider, Twofoot, Humanoid) and completed measures assessing moral foundations, anger, and social distance. Results revealed that anthropomorphism determines whether people extend moral consideration to robots, while moral foundations shape how they reason about such consideration. Qualitative analysis revealed distinct reasoning patterns: low-progressivism individuals employed character-based judgments, while high-progressivism individuals engaged in future-oriented moral deliberation. Findings offer implications for robot design and policy communication.

Abstract: Programming by demonstration is a strategy to simplify the robot programming process for non-experts via human demonstrations. However, its adoption for bimanual tasks is an underexplored problem due to the complexity of hand coordination, which also hinders data recording. This paper presents a novel one-shot method for processing a single RGB video of a bimanual task demonstration to generate an execution plan for a dual-arm robotic system. To detect hand coordination policies, we apply Shannon's information theory to analyze the information flow between scene elements and leverage scene graph properties. The generated plan is a modular behavior tree that assumes different structures based on the desired arms coordination. We validated the effectiveness of this framework through multiple subject video demonstrations, which we collected and made open-source, and exploiting data from an external, publicly available dataset. Comparisons with existing methods revealed significant improvements in generating a centralized execution plan for coordinating two-arm systems.

Abstract: Existing human-robot interaction systems often lack mechanisms for sustained personalization and dynamic adaptation in multi-user environments, limiting their effectiveness in real-world deployments. We present HARMONI, a multimodal personalization framework that leverages large language models to enable socially assistive robots to manage long-term multi-user interactions. The framework integrates four key modules: (i) a perception module that identifies active speakers and extracts multimodal input; (ii) a world modeling module that maintains representations of the environment and short-term conversational context; (iii) a user modeling module that updates long-term speaker-specific profiles; and (iv) a generation module that produces contextually grounded and ethically informed responses. Through extensive evaluation and ablation studies on four datasets, as well as a real-world scenario-driven user-study in a nursing home environment, we demonstrate that HARMONI supports robust speaker identification, online memory updating, and ethically aligned personalization, outperforming baseline LLM-driven approaches in user modeling accuracy, personalization quality, and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Industry 5.0 focuses on human-centric collaboration between humans and robots, prioritizing safety, comfort, and trust. This study introduces a data-driven framework to assess trust using behavioral indicators. The framework employs a Preference-Based Optimization algorithm to generate trust-enhancing trajectories based on operator feedback. This feedback serves as ground truth for training machine learning models to predict trust levels from behavioral indicators. The framework was tested in a chemical industry scenario where a robot assisted a human operator in mixing chemicals. Machine learning models classified trust with over 80\% accuracy, with the Voting Classifier achieving 84.07\% accuracy and an AUC-ROC score of 0.90. These findings underscore the effectiveness of data-driven methods in assessing trust within human-robot collaboration, emphasizing the valuable role behavioral indicators play in predicting the dynamics of human trust.
