A prevailing approach is large-scale imitation learning on expert driving datasets, aimed at generalizing across diverse real-world scenarios. For online trajectory generation, such methods must operate at real-time rates. Diffusion models require hundreds of denoising steps at inference, resulting in high latency. Consistency models mitigate this issue but rely on carefully tuned noise schedules to capture the multimodal action distributions common in autonomous driving. Adapting the schedule, typically requires expensive retraining. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on conditional flow matching that jointly predicts future motions of surrounding agents and plans the ego trajectory in real time. We train a lightweight variance estimator that selects the number of inference steps online, removing the need for retraining to balance runtime and imitation learning performance. To further enhance ride quality, we introduce a trajectory post-processing step cast as a convex quadratic program, with negligible computational overhead. Trained on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, the framework performs maneuvers such as lane changes, cruise control, and navigating unprotected left turns without requiring scenario-specific tuning. Our method maintains a 20 Hz update rate on an NVIDIA RTX 3070 GPU, making it suitable for online deployment. Compared to transformer, diffusion, and consistency model baselines, we achieve improved trajectory smoothness and better adherence to dynamic constraints.

The last two authors advised equally", "summary": "Robots operating in unstructured human environments inevitably encounter failures, especially in robot caregiving scenarios. While humans can often help robots recover, excessive or poorly targeted queries impose unnecessary cognitive and physical workload on the human partner. We present a human-in-the-loop failure-recovery framework for modular robotic policies, where a policy is composed of distinct modules such as perception, planning, and control, any of which may fail and often require different forms of human feedback. Our framework integrates calibrated estimates of module-level uncertainty with models of human intervention cost to decide which module to query and when to query the human. It separates these two decisions: a module selector identifies the module most likely responsible for failure, and a querying algorithm determines whether to solicit human input or act autonomously. We evaluate several module-selection strategies and querying algorithms in controlled synthetic experiments, revealing trade-offs between recovery efficiency, robustness to system and user variables, and user workload. Finally, we deploy the framework on a robot-assisted bite acquisition system and demonstrate, in studies involving individuals with both emulated and real mobility limitations, that it improves recovery success while reducing the workload imposed on users. Our results highlight how explicitly reasoning about both robot uncertainty and human effort can enable more efficient and user-centered failure recovery in collaborative robots.

The method is implemented in a symbolic optimization framework that enables continuous paths and precise control over trajectory shape. Trajectories are planned over a cost surface that encodes obstacles as continuous fields rather than discrete boundaries. Regions near obstacles are assigned higher costs, naturally encouraging the trajectory to maintain a safe distance while still allowing efficient routing through constrained spaces. The use of composite Bernstein polynomials preserves continuity while enabling fine control over local curvature to satisfy geodesic constraints. The symbolic representation supports exact derivatives, improving optimization efficiency. The method applies to both two- and three-dimensional environments and is suitable for ground, aerial, underwater, and space systems. In spacecraft trajectory planning, for example, it enables the generation of continuous, dynamically feasible trajectories with high numerical efficiency, making it well suited for orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and proximity operations, cluttered gravitational environments, and planetary exploration missions with limited onboard computational resources. Demonstrations show that the approach efficiently generates smooth, collision-free paths in scenarios with multiple obstacles, maintaining clearance without extensive sampling or post-processing. The optimization incorporates three constraint types: (1) a Gaussian surface inequality enforcing minimum obstacle clearance; (2) geodesic equations guiding the path along locally efficient directions on the cost surface; and (3) boundary constraints enforcing fixed start and end conditions.

To facilitate versatile skill control, we train a style-conditioned policy capable of generating diverse and robust locomotion skills with high fidelity to specified styles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate real-time adaptation of legged locomotion using high-level reasoning from environmental semantics and instructions with instruction-following accuracy of up to 87% without the need for online query to on-the-cloud foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u6280\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe87%\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u73af\u5883\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u878d\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u9762\u5411\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u63a5\u5730\u6280\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7ea7\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63a5\u5730\u5230\u6280\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff1b3. \u8bad\u7ec3\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\uff1b4. \u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6280\u80fd\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u4e91\u7aef\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe87%\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2\u4e91\u7aef\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u54cd\u5e94\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which serves as the primary mechanism for adapting VLAs to downstream domains, requires substantial amounts of task-specific data and is prone to catastrophic forgetting. To address these limitations, we propose LifeLong-RFT, a simple yet effective Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) strategy for VLA models independent of online environmental feedback and pre-trained reward models. By integrating chunking-level on-policy reinforcement learning with the proposed Multi-Dimensional Process Reward (MDPR) mechanism, LifeLong-RFT quantifies the heterogeneous contributions of intermediate action chunks across three dimensions to facilitate policy optimization. Specifically, (1) the Quantized Action Consistency Reward (QACR) ensures accurate action prediction within the discrete action space; (2) the Continuous Trajectory Alignment Reward (CTAR) aligns decoded continuous action chunks with reference trajectories to ensure precise control; (3) the Format Compliance Reward (FCR) guarantees the structural validity of outputs. Comprehensive experiments across SimplerEnv, LIBERO, and real-world tasks demonstrate that LifeLong-RFT exhibits strong performance in multi-task learning. Furthermore, for continual learning on the LIBERO benchmark, our method achieves a 22% gain in average success rate over SFT, while effectively adapting to new tasks using only 20% of the training data.

Our framework leverages Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) enhanced by a progressive curriculum strategy, which effectively overcomes the sparse-reward exploration challenges inherent in mechanically coupled systems. We demonstrate robust performance in simulation and successful transfer to physical hardware, executing multi-directional jumps onto platforms up to 1.5 m in height. Specifically, one of the robots achieves a foot-end elevation of 1.1 m, which represents a 144% improvement over the 0.45 m jump height of a standalone quadrupedal robot, demonstrating superior vertical performance.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Multi-sensor fusion is central to robust robotic perception, yet most existing systems operate under static sensor configurations, collecting all modalities at fixed rates and fidelity regardless of their situational utility. This rigidity wastes bandwidth, computation, and energy, and prevents systems from prioritizing sensors under challenging conditions such as poor lighting or occlusion. Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and modality-aware fusion suggest the potential for adaptive perception, but prior efforts have largely focused on re-weighting features at inference time, ignoring the physical cost of sensor data collection. We introduce a framework that unifies sensing, learning, and actuation into a closed reconfiguration loop. A task-specific detection backbone extracts multispectral features (e.g. RGB, IR, mmWave, depth) and produces quantitative contribution scores for each modality. These scores are passed to an RL agent, which dynamically adjusts sensor configurations, including sampling frequency, resolution, sensing range, and etc., in real time.

Despite large-scale multi-embodiment pre-training, existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) remain tightly coupled to their training embodiments and typically require costly fine-tuning. We introduce Language-Action Pre-training (LAP), a simple recipe that represents low-level robot actions directly in natural language, aligning action supervision with the pre-trained vision-language model's input-output distribution. LAP requires no learned tokenizer, no costly annotation, and no embodiment-specific architectural design. Based on LAP, we present LAP-3B, which to the best of our knowledge is the first VLA to achieve substantial zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robot embodiments without any embodiment-specific fine-tuning. Across multiple novel robots and manipulation tasks, LAP-3B attains over 50% average zero-shot success, delivering roughly a 2x improvement over the strongest prior VLAs.

In this framework, a mobile manipulator handles heterogeneous functional modules including structural, joint, and wheeled modules to dynamically assemble diverse robot configurations and provide them with immediate locomotion capability. To address the state-space explosion in large-scale heterogeneous reconfiguration, we propose a hierarchical planner: the high-level planner uses a bidirectional heuristic search with type-penalty terms to generate module-handling sequences, while the low level planner employs A* search to compute optimal execution trajectories. This design effectively decouples discrete configuration planning from continuous motion execution. For adaptive motion generation of unknown assembled configurations, we introduce a GPU accelerated Annealing-Variance Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller. By incorporating a multi stage variance annealing strategy to balance global exploration and local convergence, the controller enables configuration-agnostic, real-time motion control. Large scale simulations show that the type-penalty term is critical for planning robustness in heterogeneous scenarios. Moreover, the greedy heuristic produces plans with lower physical execution costs than the Hungarian heuristic. The proposed annealing-variance MPPI significantly outperforms standard MPPI in both velocity tracking accuracy and control frequency, achieving real time control at 50 Hz. The framework validates the full-cycle process, including module assembly, robot merging and splitting, and dynamic motion generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4ece\u5f62\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u5230\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5168\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548cGPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u9000\u706b\u65b9\u5deeMPPI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u77e5\u88c5\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6a21\u5757\u7ec4\u88c5\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff1a\u9ad8\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u7c7b\u578b\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u5904\u7406\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u4f7f\u7528A*\u641c\u7d22\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u5f15\u5165GPU\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u9000\u706b\u65b9\u5deeMPPI\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u5dee\u9000\u706b\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u5c40\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u7c7b\u578b\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u573a\u666f\u89c4\u5212\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u8d2a\u5a6a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6bd4\u5308\u7259\u5229\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f4e\u7269\u7406\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u7684\u89c4\u5212\uff1b\u9000\u706b\u65b9\u5deeMPPI\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u9891\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6MPPI\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b050Hz\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u7ec4\u88c5\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5408\u5e76\u4e0e\u5206\u88c2\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5168\u5468\u671f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior work has investigated using flow as an intermediate representation to enable the use of human videos as a substitute, thereby reducing the amount of required robot demonstrations. However, most prior work has focused on the flow, either on the object or on specific points of the robot/hand, which cannot describe the motion of interaction. Meanwhile, relying on flow to achieve generalization to scenarios observed only in human videos remains limited, as flow alone cannot capture precise motion details. Furthermore, conditioning on scene observation to produce precise actions may cause the flow-conditioned policy to overfit to training tasks and weaken the generalization indicated by the flow. To address these gaps, we propose SFCrP, which includes a Scene Flow prediction model for Cross-embodiment learning (SFCr) and a Flow and Cropped point cloud conditioned Policy (FCrP). SFCr learns from both robot and human videos and predicts any point trajectories. FCrP follows the general flow motion and adjusts the action based on observations for precision tasks. Our method outperforms SOTA baselines across various real-world task settings, while also exhibiting strong spatial and instance generalization to scenarios seen only in human videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "SFCrP\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u70b9\u4e91\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a1\uff09\u5149\u6d41\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u7269\u4f53\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b2\uff09\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5149\u6d41\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u524a\u5f31\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSFCrP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09SFCr\uff08\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff1a\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u610f\u70b9\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b2\uff09FCrP\uff08\u6d41\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u70b9\u4e91\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff1a\u9075\u5faa\u901a\u7528\u6d41\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u8c03\u6574\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4ec5\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "SFCrP\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5149\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8de8\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6f14\u793a\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd"}}

This paper presents a nonlinear, model-based framework for magnetic pitch control of an ingestible capsule robot actuated by a four-coil electromagnetic array. Angle-dependent magnetic forces and torques acting on embedded permanent magnets are characterized using three-dimensional finite-element simulations and embedded as lookup tables in a control-oriented rigid-body pitching model with rolling contact and actuator dynamics. A constrained model predictive controller (MPC) is designed to regulate pitch while respecting hardware-imposed current and slew-rate limits. Experiments on a compliant stomach-inspired surface demonstrate robust pitch reorientation from both horizontal and upright configurations, achieving about three to five times faster settling and reduced oscillatory motion than on-off control. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing inertial sensing with intermittent visual measurements enables stable closed-loop control when the camera update rate is reduced from 30 Hz to 1 Hz, emulating clinically realistic imaging constraints. These results establish finite-element-informed MPC with sensor fusion as a scalable strategy for pitch regulation, controlled docking, and future multi-degree-of-freedom capsule locomotion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u4eff\u771f\u5efa\u7acb\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u78c1\u529b/\u529b\u77e9\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6eda\u52a8\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u80c3\u58c1\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u4fef\u4ef0\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4fef\u4ef0\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u80f6\u56ca\u4e0e\u503e\u659c\u80c3\u58c1\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u4ea4\u4e92\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fef\u4ef0\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u7ebf\u5708\u7535\u78c1\u9635\u5217\u9a71\u52a8\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ef4\u6709\u9650\u5143\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u5f81\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u78c1\u529b\u548c\u529b\u77e9\uff0c\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u521a\u4f53\u4fef\u4ef0\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08MPC\uff09\u8c03\u8282\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u786c\u4ef6\u7535\u6d41\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff1b4. \u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08EKF\uff09\u878d\u5408\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u95f4\u6b47\u89c6\u89c9\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u67d4\u6027\u80c3\u58c1\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4fef\u4ef0\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f00\u5173\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5feb3-5\u500d\u4e14\u632f\u8361\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u76f8\u673a\u66f4\u65b0\u7387\u4ece30Hz\u964d\u81f31Hz\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u6210\u50cf\u9650\u5236\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ed\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6709\u9650\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\u5316\u7684MPC\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u4fef\u4ef0\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u53d7\u63a7\u5bf9\u63a5\u548c\u672a\u6765\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u80f6\u56ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u78c1\u9a71\u52a8\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u80c3\u80a0\u9053\u8bca\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Conventional magnetic capsule robots embed bulky permanent magnets at both ends, reducing the usable cavity by about 10-20 mm and limiting integration of functional modules. We propose a compact, 3D-printed soft capsule robot with a magnetic coating that replaces internal magnets, enabling locomotion via a thin, functional shell while preserving the entire interior cavity as a continuous volume for medical payloads. The compliant silicone-magnetic composite also improves swallowability, even with a slightly larger capsule size. Magnetostatic simulations and experiments confirm that programmed NSSN/SNNS pole distributions provide strong anisotropy and reliable torque generation, enabling stable bidirectional rolling, omnidirectional steering, climbing on 7.5 degree inclines, and traversal of 5 mm protrusions. Rolling motion is sustained when the magnetic field at the capsule reaches at least 0.3 mT, corresponding to an effective actuation depth of 30 mm in our setup. Future work will optimize material composition, coating thickness, and magnetic layouts to enhance force output and durability, while next-generation robotic-arm-based field generators with closed-loop feedback will address nonlinearities and expand maneuverability. Together, these advances aim to transition coating-based capsule robots toward reliable clinical deployment and broaden their applications in minimally invasive diagnostics and therapy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u76843D\u6253\u5370\u8f6f\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u78c1\u6027\u6d82\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u94c1\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u5185\u90e8\u8154\u4f53\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u8f7d\u8377\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cc\u5411\u6eda\u52a8\u548c\u5168\u65b9\u4f4d\u8f6c\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u78c1\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4e24\u7aef\u5d4c\u5165\u7b28\u91cd\u6c38\u78c1\u4f53\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea610-20\u6beb\u7c73\u53ef\u7528\u8154\u4f53\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u5185\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D\u6253\u5370\u8f6f\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u6d82\u8986\u78c1\u6027\u6d82\u5c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u5185\u90e8\u78c1\u94c1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u7a0bNSSN/SNNS\u78c1\u6781\u5206\u5e03\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u626d\u77e9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u78c1\u6027\u6d82\u5c42\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u53cc\u5411\u6eda\u52a8\u3001\u5168\u65b9\u4f4d\u8f6c\u5411\u3001\u722c\u53477.5\u5ea6\u659c\u5761\u3001\u8de8\u8d8a5\u6beb\u7c73\u7a81\u8d77\u3002\u5f53\u78c1\u573a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8fbe\u52300.3 mT\u65f6\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6eda\u52a8\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e9430\u6beb\u7c73\u6709\u6548\u9a71\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6d82\u5c42\u57fa\u80f6\u56ca\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u5185\u90e8\u8154\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u541e\u54bd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u901a\u8fc7\u6750\u6599\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u95ed\u73af\u53cd\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline.

Accurately detecting roof inclination using conventional sensing methods, such as vision-based or acoustic techniques, can be unreliable, as measurement quality is strongly influenced by external factors including weather conditions and surface materials. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel unmanned aerial manipulator morphology featuring a dual-arm aerial manipulator with an omnidirectional 3D workspace and extended reach. Building on this design, we develop a proprioceptive contact detection and contact localization strategy based on a momentum-based torque observer. This enables the UAM to infer the inclination of slanted surfaces blindly - through physical interaction - prior to touchdown.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide high-level guidance, they cannot explicitly forecast future states, and existing world models either predict only short horizons or produce spatially inconsistent frames. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for fast and predictive video-conditioned action. Our approach first selects and adapts a robust video generation model to ensure reliable future predictions, then applies adversarial distillation for fast, few-step video generation, and finally trains an action model that leverages both generated videos and real observations to correct spatial errors. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally coherent, spatially accurate video predictions that directly support precise manipulation, achieving significant improvements in embodiment consistency, spatial referring ability, and task completion over existing baselines.

The control system, powered by a Raspberry Pi 3B, includes an IMU and pressure sensor for real-time monitoring and control. Experiments in a pool assessed the robot's swimming and diving capabilities. Results show stable swimming and diving motions with PD control.

(3) The field lacks scalable fully autonomous evaluation, instead relying on simplistic 2D metrics that miss 3D spatial structure or on human-in-the-loop systems that are costly, biased, and unscalable. To address these limitations, we introduce RADAR (Real-world Autonomous Dynamics And Reasoning), a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate VLA generalization under realistic conditions. RADAR integrates three core components: (1) a principled suite of physical dynamics; (2) dedicated tasks that explicitly test spatial reasoning and physical understanding; and (3) a fully autonomous evaluation pipeline based on 3D metrics, eliminating the need for human supervision. We apply RADAR to audit multiple state-of-the-art VLA models and uncover severe fragility beneath their apparent competence. Performance drops precipitously under modest physical dynamics, with the expectation of 3D IoU declining from 0.261 to 0.068 under sensor noise. Moreover, models exhibit limited spatial reasoning capability. These findings position RADAR as a necessary bench toward reliable and generalizable real-world evaluation of VLA models.", "AI": {"tldr": "RADAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u6216\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1) \u672a\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2) \u5ffd\u89c6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\uff1b3) \u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RADAR\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5957\u4ef6\uff1b2) \u4e13\u95e8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e3D\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528RADAR\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u8106\u5f31\uff1a3D IoU\u4ece0.261\u964d\u81f30.068\uff08\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "RADAR\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

To resolve the generalization bottleneck, we introduce a hierarchical Vision-Language-Action framework \\our{} that leverages the generalization of large-scale pre-trained world model for robust and generalizable VIsual Subgoal TAsk decomposition VISTA. Our hierarchical framework \\our{} consists of a world model as the high-level planner and a VLA as the low-level executor. The high-level world model first divides manipulation tasks into subtask sequences with goal images, and the low-level policy follows the textual and visual guidance to generate action sequences. Compared to raw textual goal specification, these synthesized goal images provide visually and physically grounded details for low-level policies, making it feasible to generalize across unseen objects and novel scenarios. We validate both visual goal synthesis and our hierarchical VLA policies in massive out-of-distribution scenarios, and the performance of the same-structured VLA in novel scenarios could boost from 14% to 69% with the guidance generated by the world model. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous baselines with a clear margin, particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled path to robustness, on-policy RL in the physical world is constrained by safety risk, hardware cost, and environment reset. To bridge this gap, we present RISE, a scalable framework of robotic reinforcement learning via imagination. At its core is a Compositional World Model that (i) predicts multi-view future via a controllable dynamics model, and (ii) evaluates imagined outcomes with a progress value model, producing informative advantages for the policy improvement. Such compositional design allows state and value to be tailored by best-suited yet distinct architectures and objectives. These components are integrated into a closed-loop self-improving pipeline that continuously generates imaginary rollouts, estimates advantages, and updates the policy in imaginary space without costly physical interaction.

This field report studies a novel method for estimating the relative particle size of fragmented rock piles from only proprioceptive data collected while digging with a wheel loader. Rather than employ exteroceptive sensors (e.g., cameras or LiDAR sensors) to estimate rock particle sizes, the studied method infers rock fragmentation from an excavator's inertial response during excavation. This paper expands on research that postulated the use of wavelet analysis to construct a unique feature that is proportional to the level of rock fragmentation. We demonstrate through extensive field experiments that the ratio of wavelet features, constructed from data obtained by excavating in different rock piles with different size distributions, approximates the ratio of the mean particle size of the two rock piles. Full-scale excavation experiments were performed with a battery electric, 18-tonne capacity, load-haul-dump (LHD) machine in representative conditions in an operating quarry. The relative particle size estimates generated with the proposed sensing methodology are compared with those obtained from both a vision-based fragmentation analysis tool and from sieving of sampled materials.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6e\u5f0f\u88c5\u8f7d\u673a\u6316\u6398\u65f6\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u788e\u77f3\u5806\u76f8\u5bf9\u7c92\u5f84\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u63a8\u65ad\u5ca9\u77f3\u7834\u788e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91c7\u77ff\u548c\u91c7\u77f3\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ca9\u77f3\u7834\u788e\u5806\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u662f\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08\u5982\u76f8\u673a\u6216\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5ca9\u77f3\u7834\u788e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u5ca9\u77f3\u7834\u788e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5f84\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5ca9\u77f3\u5806\u65f6\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5c0f\u6ce2\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u7387\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5ca9\u77f3\u5806\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7c92\u5f84\u6bd4\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fd0\u8425\u91c7\u77f3\u573a\u4e2d\u4f7f\u752818\u5428\u7535\u6c60\u7535\u52a8LHD\u673a\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u6316\u6398\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7c92\u5f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7834\u788e\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7b5b\u5206\u91c7\u6837\u6750\u6599\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f6e\u5f0f\u88c5\u8f7d\u673a\u6316\u6398\u65f6\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u5c31\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u788e\u77f3\u5806\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7c92\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ca9\u77f3\u7834\u788e\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes. In this work, Normalizing flow-based hierarchical implicit Q-learning (NF-HIQL), a novel framework that replaces unimodal gaussian policies with expressive normalizing flow policies at both the high- and low-levels of the hierarchy is introduced. This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench. NF-HIQL consistently outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines, demonstrating superior robustness under limited data and highlighting the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "NF-HIQL\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u9690\u5f0fQ\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u65af\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5c42\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08H-GCRL\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u6216\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NF-HIQL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u5cf0\u9ad8\u65af\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86RealNVP\u7b56\u7565\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u548cPAC\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eNF-HIQL\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u8fd0\u7403\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b49\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cNF-HIQL\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NF-HIQL\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}
