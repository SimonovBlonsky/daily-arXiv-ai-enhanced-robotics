*Josée Mallah,Zakii Javed,Zafer Azak,Thomas Stone,Luigi G. Occhipinti*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 开发了一款轻量、低复杂度、软性双侧踝关节外骨骼，用于跖屈辅助，可安装在任意鞋子上，不影响健康步态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多人可以从步态外骨骼辅助中受益（医疗或非医疗目的），但传统外骨骼存在质量大、结构复杂、需要补偿等问题。

Method: 设计了一种轻量、低复杂度的软性双侧踝关节外骨骼，采用鞋面附着设计，可安装在任何鞋子上；开发了控制系统。

Abstract: Many people could benefit from exoskeleton assistance during gait, for either medical or nonmedical purposes. But exoskeletons bring added mass and structure, which in turn require compensating for. In this work, we present a lightweight, low-complexity, soft bilateral ankle exoskeleton for plantarflexion assistance, with a shoe attachment design that can be mounted on top of any pair of shoes. Experimental tests show no significant difference in lower limb kinematics and kinetics when wearing the exoskeleton in zero-torque mode relative to not wearing an exoskeleton, showing that our device does not obstruct healthy gait, and proving it as a compliant and comfortable device, promising to provide effective assistance. Hence, a control system was developed, and additional tests are underway.

### [2] [Enhancing Goal Inference via Correction Timing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18603)
*Anjiabei Wang,Shuangge Wang,Tesca Fitzgerald*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探索机器人纠正反馈中的时间信号价值，发现纠正时机能帮助识别引发人类干预的机器人动作特征，并快速推断纠正目标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从纠正中学习的方法将纠正视为新演示或偏好，但忽略了人类决定干预机器人行为这一关键决策时机，该时机可能包含任务进度、期望对齐、动态性、运动可读性和最优性等多重因素信息

Method: 研究纠正时机作为学习信号的价值，探索三个潜在应用：1)识别可能引发人类纠正的机器人动作特征；2)基于纠正时机和初始方向快速推断人类纠正的最终目标；3)学习更精确的任务目标约束

Result: 纠正时机在前两个应用中（识别引发纠正的特征和快速推断纠正目标）能带来改进的学习效果

Conclusion: 纠正时机作为机器人学习信号具有重要价值，为理解人类干预决策提供了新视角

Abstract: Corrections offer a natural modality for people to provide feedback to a robot, by (i) intervening in the robot's behavior when they believe the robot is failing (or will fail) the task objectives and (ii) modifying the robot's behavior to successfully fulfill the task. Each correction offers information on what the robot should and should not do, where the corrected behavior is more aligned with task objectives than the original behavior. Most prior work on learning from corrections involves interpreting a correction as a new demonstration (consisting of the modified robot behavior), or a preference (for the modified trajectory compared to the robot's original behavior). However, this overlooks one essential element of the correction feedback, which is the human's decision to intervene in the robot's behavior in the first place. This decision can be influenced by multiple factors including the robot's task progress, alignment with human expectations, dynamics, motion legibility, and optimality. In this work, we investigate whether the timing of this decision can offer a useful signal for inferring these task-relevant influences. In particular, we investigate three potential applications for this learning signal: (1) identifying features of a robot's motion that may prompt people to correct it, (2) quickly inferring the final goal of a human's correction based on the timing and initial direction of their correction motion, and (3) learning more precise constraints for task objectives. Our results indicate that correction timing results in improved learning for the first two of these applications. Overall, our work provides new insights on the value of correction timing as a signal for robot learning.

### [3] [OVerSeeC: Open-Vocabulary Costmap Generation from Satellite Images and Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18606)
*Rwik Rana,Jesse Quattrociocchi,Dongmyeong Lee,Christian Ellis,Amanda Adkins,Adam Uccello,Garrett Warnell,Joydeep Biswas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OVerSeeC是一个零样本模块化框架，通过分解为"解释-定位-合成"三个步骤，直接从卫星图像生成用于长距离规划的全局成本地图，能够处理自然语言表达的实体和任务特定遍历规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主导航需要全局上下文进行路线规划，但现有方法依赖固定本体和静态成本映射，无法适应任务需求变化、部署时未知的地形实体以及用户提示中编码的组合遍历逻辑。

Method: 提出OVerSeeC框架，包含三个模块：(1) LLM提取实体和排名偏好；(2) 开放词汇分割管道从高分辨率图像中识别这些实体；(3) LLM使用用户自然语言偏好和掩码合成可执行的成本地图代码。

Result: OVerSeeC能够处理新颖实体，尊重排名和组合偏好，在不同区域产生与人类绘制轨迹一致的路由，展示了分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基础模型的模块化组合能够实现开放词汇、偏好对齐的成本地图生成，支持可扩展、任务自适应的全局规划。

Abstract: Aerial imagery provides essential global context for autonomous navigation, enabling route planning at scales inaccessible to onboard sensing. We address the problem of generating global costmaps for long-range planning directly from satellite imagery when entities and mission-specific traversal rules are expressed in natural language at test time. This setting is challenging since mission requirements vary, terrain entities may be unknown at deployment, and user prompts often encode compositional traversal logic. Existing approaches relying on fixed ontologies and static cost mappings cannot accommodate such flexibility. While foundation models excel at language interpretation and open-vocabulary perception, no single model can simultaneously parse nuanced mission directives, locate arbitrary entities in large-scale imagery, and synthesize them into an executable cost function for planners. We therefore propose OVerSeeC, a zero-shot modular framework that decomposes the problem into Interpret-Locate-Synthesize: (i) an LLM extracts entities and ranked preferences, (ii) an open-vocabulary segmentation pipeline identifies these entities from high-resolution imagery, and (iii) the LLM uses the user's natural language preferences and masks to synthesize executable costmap code. Empirically, OVerSeeC handles novel entities, respects ranked and compositional preferences, and produces routes consistent with human-drawn trajectories across diverse regions, demonstrating robustness to distribution shifts. This shows that modular composition of foundation models enables open-vocabulary, preference-aligned costmap generation for scalable, mission-adaptive global planning.

### [4] [FORMICA: Decision-Focused Learning for Communication-Free Multi-Robot Task Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18622)
*Antonio Lopez,Jack Muirhead,Carlo Pinciroli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FORMICA：无需机器人间通信的隐式协调任务分配框架，通过预测队友出价分布来优化分配决策，在有限带宽环境下显著提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多机器人任务分配方法依赖通信来协调分配，但在带宽受限、基础设施退化或对抗干扰的环境中性能急剧下降。需要开发无需机器人间通信的高质量任务分配方法。

Method: 提出FORMICA框架，核心思想是机器人通过预测队友的出价分布来实现隐式协调。采用学习方法来预测出价分布，纠正分析性平均场近似的系统误差。受SPO启发，端到端训练预测器以最小化任务分配遗憾而非预测误差。为扩展到大规模群体，开发平均场近似，每个机器人预测竞争出价的分布而非个体出价，将复杂度从O(NT)降至O(T)。

Result: 在16个机器人和64个任务的场景中，FORMICA将系统奖励提升17%，接近最优MILP解。在更大规模场景（256个机器人，4096个任务）中，相同模型将性能提升7%，展示出强泛化能力。训练仅需21秒，能快速适应新环境。

Conclusion: FORMICA框架在无需机器人间通信的情况下实现了高质量的任务分配，通过预测出价分布的隐式协调方法在带宽受限环境中表现优异，具有可扩展性和快速适应能力。

Abstract: Most multi-robot task allocation methods rely on communication to resolve conflicts and reach consistent assignments. In environments with limited bandwidth, degraded infrastructure, or adversarial interference, existing approaches degrade sharply. We introduce a learning-based framework that achieves high-quality task allocation without any robot-to-robot communication. The key idea is that robots coordinate implicitly by predicting teammates' bids: if each robot can anticipate competition for a task, it can adjust its choices accordingly. Our method predicts bid distributions to correct systematic errors in analytical mean-field approximations. While analytical predictions assume idealized conditions (uniform distributions, known bid functions), our learned approach adapts to task clustering and spatial heterogeneity. Inspired by Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO), we train predictors end-to-end to minimize Task Allocation Regret rather than prediction error. To scale to large swarms, we develop a mean-field approximation where each robot predicts the distribution of competing bids rather than individual bids, reducing complexity from $O(NT)$ to $O(T)$. We call our approach FORMICA: Field-Oriented Regret-Minimizing Implicit Coordination Algorithm. Experiments show FORMICA substantially outperforms a natural analytical baseline. In scenarios with 16 robots and 64 tasks, our approach improves system reward by 17% and approaches the optimal MILP solution. When deployed on larger scenarios (256 robots, 4096 tasks), the same model improves performance by 7%, demonstrating strong generalization. Training requires only 21 seconds on a laptop, enabling rapid adaptation to new environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于双足机器人的软表面视觉触觉足部传感器，通过光学捕获接触变形，将足地交互转化为丰富的触觉信号，从而提升机器人的平衡控制和地形感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足式机器人运动受益于具身感知，即感知源于身体与环境的物理交互。现有系统主要依赖本体感觉，缺乏对接触细节的丰富感知，限制了机器人在复杂地形中的稳定性和适应性。

Method: 开发了一种软表面视觉触觉足部传感器，在机器人足部添加皮肤状可变形层，通过光学方式捕获接触变形。从接触图像流中估计接触姿态（位置和方向）、可视化剪切力、计算压力中心、分类地形并检测接触斑块的几何特征。

Result: 在倾斜平台和视觉遮挡条件下验证了传感器能力，表明足部触觉反馈相比单独的本体感觉能显著改善平衡控制和地形感知。触觉感知提高了机器人的稳定性、适应性和环境意识。

Conclusion: 将触觉感知集成到足式机器人足部可以改善稳定性、适应性和环境意识，为实现更柔顺和智能的运动系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Legged locomotion benefits from embodied sensing, where perception emerges from the physical interaction between body and environment. We present a soft-surfaced, vision-based tactile foot sensor that endows a bipedal robot with a skin-like deformable layer that captures contact deformations optically, turning foot-ground interactions into rich haptic signals. From a contact image stream, our method estimates contact pose (position and orientation), visualizes shear, computes center of pressure (CoP), classifies terrain, and detects geometric features of the contact patch. We validate these capabilities on a tilting platform and in visually obscured conditions, showing that foot-borne tactile feedback improves balance control and terrain awareness beyond proprioception alone. These findings suggest that integrating tactile perception into legged robot feet improves stability, adaptability, and environmental awareness, offering a promising direction toward more compliant and intelligent locomotion systems.

TL;DR: 开发可调软物理孪生体模拟不同成熟度水果的刚度特性，为机器人抓取器提供可持续、可控的测试平台


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球农业食品行业面临劳动力短缺、高消费需求和供应链中断等挑战，导致大量未收获农产品损失。机器人采摘成为有前景的替代方案，但由于天然农产品机械特性高度可变，评估和训练用于精细水果的软抓取器仍然困难。现有测试方法依赖大量真实水果来捕捉这种变异性，导致效率低下、成本增加和浪费。

Method: 开发可调软物理孪生体，模拟不同成熟度真实水果的刚度特性。设计并制造了猕猴桃的纤维增强气动物理孪生体，以复制不同成熟度水平的刚度。通过实验验证物理孪生体刚度可精确调节，并利用商用机器人抓取器进行抓取任务测试。

Result: 实验结果显示，物理孪生体的刚度可在多次试验中精确调节（97.35-99.43%准确度）。抓取任务表明，来自物理孪生体的传感器反馈能够反映施加的抓取力。经过50次循环的应力测试显示，所需刚度可靠维持（0.56-1.10%误差）。

Conclusion: 机器人物理孪生体能够调整其刚度以模拟真实水果，为机器人抓取器的基准测试和训练提供可持续、可控的平台。该方法解决了现有测试方法的局限性，减少了真实水果的依赖，提高了测试效率和可持续性。

Abstract: The global agri-food sector faces increasing challenges from labour shortages, high consumer demand, and supply-chain disruptions, resulting in substantial losses of unharvested produce. Robotic harvesting has emerged as a promising alternative; however, evaluating and training soft grippers for delicate fruits remains difficult due to the highly variable mechanical properties of natural produce. This makes it difficult to establish reliable benchmarks or data-driven control strategies. Existing testing practices rely on large quantities of real fruit to capture this variability, leading to inefficiency, higher costs, and waste. The methodology presented in this work aims to address these limitations by developing tunable soft physical twins that emulate the stiffness characteristics of real fruits at different ripeness levels. A fiber-reinforced pneumatic physical twin of a kiwi fruit was designed and fabricated to replicate the stiffness at different ripeness levels. Experimental results show that the stiffness of the physical twin can be tuned accurately over multiple trials (97.35 - 99.43% accuracy). Gripping tasks with a commercial robotic gripper showed that sensor feedback from the physical twin can reflect the applied gripping forces. Finally, a stress test was performed over 50 cycles showed reliable maintenance of desired stiffness (0.56 - 1.10% error). This work shows promise that robotic physical twins could adjust their stiffness to resemble that of real fruits. This can provide a sustainable, controllable platform for benchmarking and training robotic grippers.

TL;DR: 提出分层模块化多智能体强化学习框架，用于急性缺血性卒中机械取栓的自主血管内导航，在体外实验中实现从股动脉到颈内动脉的导航


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机械取栓是治疗大血管闭塞性急性缺血性卒中的最佳方法，但受地理和物流限制难以普及；强化学习在自主血管内导航中显示潜力，但在"长"导航任务中的泛化能力仍面临挑战

Method: 提出分层模块化多智能体强化学习框架，将复杂的双器械导航任务分解为专门子任务，每个子任务使用Soft Actor-Critic强化学习进行训练，并在硅基和体外测试平台上验证

Result: 硅基模型中，单血管模型在个体解剖结构上达到92-100%成功率，多血管模型在多个患者解剖结构上达到56-80%成功率；体外实验中，HM-MARL模型成功导航100%试验从股动脉到右颈总动脉，80%到右颈内动脉，但在左侧血管超人类挑战中失败

Conclusion: 这是首次在机械取栓血管系统中展示体外自主导航的研究，HM-MARL实现了跨解剖结构的泛化，但仿真到现实的转换仍存在挑战，未来工作将使用世界模型优化强化学习策略并在未见体外数据上验证性能

Abstract: Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is typically the optimal treatment for acute ischemic stroke involving large vessel occlusions, but access is limited due to geographic and logistical barriers. Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise in autonomous endovascular navigation, but generalization across 'long' navigation tasks remains challenging. We propose a Hierarchical Modular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HM-MARL) framework for autonomous two-device navigation in vitro, enabling efficient and generalizable navigation. HM-MARL was developed to autonomously navigate a guide catheter and guidewire from the femoral artery to the internal carotid artery (ICA). A modular multi-agent approach was used to decompose the complex navigation task into specialized subtasks, each trained using Soft Actor-Critic RL. The framework was validated in both in silico and in vitro testbeds to assess generalization and real-world feasibility. In silico, a single-vasculature model achieved 92-100% success rates on individual anatomies, while a multi-vasculature model achieved 56-80% across multiple patient anatomies. In vitro, both HM-MARL models successfully navigated 100% of trials from the femoral artery to the right common carotid artery and 80% to the right ICA but failed on the left-side vessel superhuman challenge due to the anatomy and catheter type used in navigation. This study presents the first demonstration of in vitro autonomous navigation in MT vasculature. While HM-MARL enables generalization across anatomies, the simulation-to-real transition introduces challenges. Future work will refine RL strategies using world models and validate performance on unseen in vitro data, advancing autonomous MT towards clinical translation.

Motivation: 行星表面如火星沙丘和月球陨石坑等科学价值区域因松散可变形表土而危险，现有轮式漫游车难以安全进入，需要新的方法扩展可访问的科学工作空间

Method: 采用腿式机器人作为移动侦察员，通过行走时的本体感知腿-地形交互在线估计表土强度，构建空间分辨率地形图，结合漫游车运动模型估计穿越风险并指导路径规划

Conclusion: 通过结合本体地形感知与异构漫游车协作，该框架增强了操作鲁棒性，扩展了可变形行星环境中可到达的科学工作空间

Abstract: Robot-aided exploration of planetary surfaces is essential for understanding geologic processes, yet many scientifically valuable regions, such as Martian dunes and lunar craters, remain hazardous due to loose, deformable regolith. We present a scout-rover cooperation framework that expands safe access to such terrain using a hybrid team of legged and wheeled robots. In our approach, a high-mobility legged robot serves as a mobile scout, using proprioceptive leg-terrain interactions to estimate regolith strength during locomotion and construct spatially resolved terrain maps. These maps are integrated with rover locomotion models to estimate traversal risk and inform path planning.
  We validate the framework through analogue missions at the NASA Ames Lunar Simulant Testbed and the White Sands Dune Field. Experiments demonstrate (1) online terrain strength mapping from legged locomotion and (2) rover-specific traversal-risk estimation enabling safe navigation to scientific targets. Results show that scout-generated terrain maps reliably capture spatial variability and predict mobility failure modes, allowing risk-aware path planning that avoids hazardous regions. By combining embodied terrain sensing with heterogeneous rover cooperation, this framework enhances operational robustness and expands the reachable science workspace in deformable planetary environments.

*Haotian He,Ning Guo,Siqi Shi,Qipeng Liu,Wenzhao Lian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLASH框架通过少量真实数据学习碰撞模型，创建高保真混合仿真器，显著缩小仿真与现实差距，提升策略迁移成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿真与现实之间的差距，特别是在碰撞等接触密集型动力学建模不准确的问题，是部署仿真训练机器人策略的主要障碍。传统物理引擎通常在精度和计算速度之间权衡，导致策略无法直接迁移。

Method: 提出CLASH框架：首先从不完美仿真器（MuJoCo）中提取基础模型以获取物理先验知识；然后用极少量的真实世界交互数据（少至10个样本）进行微调，修正仿真器的固有误差，创建高保真混合仿真器。

Result: 混合仿真器不仅预测精度更高，还将碰撞计算时间减少近50%。使用该仿真器训练的策略在真实世界中迁移更稳健，在顺序推动任务中成功率翻倍，基于模型控制的任务性能显著提升。

Conclusion: CLASH框架通过数据高效的方式学习碰撞模型，有效缩小仿真与现实差距，为机器人策略的仿真训练和现实部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The sim-to-real gap, particularly in the inaccurate modeling of contact-rich dynamics like collisions, remains a primary obstacle to deploying robot policies trained in simulation. Conventional physics engines often trade accuracy for computational speed, leading to discrepancies that prevent direct policy transfer. To address this, we introduce Collision Learning via Augmented Sim-to-real Hybridization (CLASH), a data-efficient framework that creates a high-fidelity hybrid simulator by learning a surrogate collision model from a minimal set of real-world data. In CLASH, a base model is first distilled from an imperfect simulator (MuJoCo) to capture general physical priors; this model is then fine-tuned with a remarkably small number of real-world interactions (as few as 10 samples) to correct for the simulator's inherent inaccuracies. The resulting hybrid simulator not only achieves higher predictive accuracy but also reduces collision computation time by nearly 50\%. We demonstrate that policies obtained with our hybrid simulator transfer more robustly to the real world, doubling the success rate in sequential pushing tasks with reinforecement learning and significantly increase the task performance with model-based control.

*Seungku Kim,Suhyeok Jang,Byungjun Yoon,Dongyoung Kim,John Won,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboCurate是一个新颖的机器人合成数据生成框架，通过模拟回放评估和过滤生成视频中的动作质量，结合图像编辑和视频转换增强数据多样性，显著提升机器人学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频生成模型产生的合成数据在机器人学习中具有可扩展性潜力，但存在动作质量不一致的问题。现有的视觉语言模型在验证视频质量方面有局限性，无法准确评估物理准确性或直接评估生成的动作本身。

Method: RoboCurate通过在模拟器中回放预测动作，并比较模拟回放与生成视频之间的运动一致性来评估动作质量。此外，通过图像到图像编辑解锁超出可用数据集的观察多样性，并应用保持动作的视频到视频转换来进一步增强外观。

Result: RoboCurate生成的合成数据相比仅使用真实数据，在多个基准测试中取得了显著改进：GR-1 Tabletop（300个演示）成功率相对提升+70.1%，DexMimicGen预训练设置中提升+16.1%，在具有挑战性的真实世界ALLEX人形灵巧操作设置中提升+179.9%。

Conclusion: RoboCurate通过模拟回放验证动作质量的方法有效解决了合成机器人数据中动作质量不一致的问题，结合数据增强技术显著提升了机器人学习的性能，为可扩展的机器人学习数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by video generative models has shown promise for robot learning as a scalable pipeline, but it often suffers from inconsistent action quality due to imperfectly generated videos. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have been leveraged to validate video quality, but they have limitations in distinguishing physically accurate videos and, even then, cannot directly evaluate the generated actions themselves. To tackle this issue, we introduce RoboCurate, a novel synthetic robot data generation framework that evaluates and filters the quality of annotated actions by comparing them with simulation replay. Specifically, RoboCurate replays the predicted actions in a simulator and assesses action quality by measuring the consistency of motion between the simulator rollout and the generated video. In addition, we unlock observation diversity beyond the available dataset via image-to-image editing and apply action-preserving video-to-video transfer to further augment appearance. We observe RoboCurate's generated data yield substantial relative improvements in success rates compared to using real data only, achieving +70.1% on GR-1 Tabletop (300 demos), +16.1% on DexMimicGen in the pre-training setup, and +179.9% in the challenging real-world ALLEX humanoid dexterous manipulation setting.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LoTIS是一个视觉导航模型，通过将参考RGB轨迹定位到机器人当前视图中，提供机器人无关的图像空间引导，无需相机标定、位姿或机器人特定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉导航方法通常与特定机器人绑定，需要相机标定、位姿信息或机器人特定训练，限制了跨平台部署的灵活性。本文旨在开发一种机器人无关的视觉导航方法，能够零样本适应不同机器人平台。

Method: 模型不预测与特定机器人绑定的动作，而是预测参考轨迹点在机器人当前视图中的图像空间坐标。通过解耦感知与动作，学习定位轨迹点而非模仿行为先验，采用跨轨迹训练策略增强对视角和相机变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在传统前向导航任务中，比现有最佳方法提高20-50个百分点，在多样仿真和真实环境中达到94-98%的成功率。在具有挑战性的任务（如后向遍历）上，比基线方法提升超过5倍，基线方法在这些任务上完全失败。

Conclusion: LoTIS提供了一种简单易用的机器人无关视觉导航方案，仅需手机拍摄的视频即可让不同机器人沿着轨迹导航。该方法通过图像空间引导实现了零样本跨平台部署，显著提升了导航性能。

Abstract: We present LoTIS, a model for visual navigation that provides robot-agnostic image-space guidance by localizing a reference RGB trajectory in the robot's current view, without requiring camera calibration, poses, or robot-specific training. Instead of predicting actions tied to specific robots, we predict the image-space coordinates of the reference trajectory as they would appear in the robot's current view. This creates robot-agnostic visual guidance that easily integrates with local planning. Consequently, our model's predictions provide guidance zero-shot across diverse embodiments. By decoupling perception from action and learning to localize trajectory points rather than imitate behavioral priors, we enable a cross-trajectory training strategy for robustness to viewpoint and camera changes. We outperform state-of-the-art methods by 20-50 percentage points in success rate on conventional forward navigation, achieving 94-98% success rate across diverse sim and real environments. Furthermore, we achieve over 5x improvements on challenging tasks where baselines fail, such as backward traversal. The system is straightforward to use: we show how even a video from a phone camera directly enables different robots to navigate to any point on the trajectory. Videos, demo, and code are available at https://finnbusch.com/lotis.

TL;DR: Habilis-β是一个快速运动、持久运行的设备端视觉-语言-动作模型，通过生产力-可靠性平面评估框架，在连续运行协议下实现了显著优于基准模型的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA评估主要局限于单次试验成功率，无法捕捉实际应用中所需的快速运动和持久运行能力，因此需要新的评估框架和模型设计来满足真实世界部署需求。

Method: 1) 引入生产力-可靠性平面评估框架，使用每小时任务数和平均干预间隔时间评估性能；2) 结合无语言预训练获取交互先验和循环任务演示训练处理状态漂移；3) 采用ESPADA进行相位自适应运动规划加速自由空间移动；4) 使用整流流蒸馏实现边缘设备高频控制；5) 部署时使用无分类器引导动态平衡指令遵循和交互先验。

Result: 在1小时连续运行评估中，Habilis-β在模拟环境中达到572.6 TPH和39.2秒MTBI（vs. π0.5的120.5 TPH和30.5秒），在真实世界人形机器人物流工作流中达到124 TPH和137.4秒MTBI（vs. π0.5的19 TPH和46.1秒），并在RoboTwin 2.0排行榜上取得最高性能。

Conclusion: Habilis-β通过创新的评估框架和模型架构设计，在快速运动和持久运行能力方面显著优于现有方法，为真实世界VLA部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Habilis-$β$, a fast-motion and long-lasting on-device vision-language-action (VLA) model designed for real-world deployment. Current VLA evaluation remains largely confined to single-trial success rates under curated resets, which fails to capture the fast-motion and long-lasting capabilities essential for practical operation. To address this, we introduce the Productivity-Reliability Plane (PRP), which evaluates performance through Tasks per Hour (TPH) and Mean Time Between Intervention (MTBI) under a continuous-run protocol that demands both high-speed execution and sustained robustness. Habilis-$β$ achieves high performance by integrating language-free pre-training on large-scale play data for robust interaction priors with post-training on cyclic task demonstrations that capture state drift across consecutive task iterations. The system further employs ESPADA for phase-adaptive motion shaping to accelerate free-space transit, utilizes rectified-flow distillation to enable high-frequency control on edge devices, and incorporates classifier-free guidance (CFG) as a deployment-time knob to dynamically balance instruction adherence and learned interaction priors. In 1-hour continuous-run evaluations, Habilis-$β$ achieves strong performance under the PRP metrics, compared to $π_{0.5}$ in both simulation and real-world environments. In simulation, Habilis-$β$ achieves 572.6 TPH and 39.2 s MTBI (vs. 120.5 TPH and 30.5 s for $π_{0.5}$), while in a real-world humanoid logistics workflow it achieves 124 TPH and 137.4 s MTBI (vs. 19 TPH and 46.1 s for $π_{0.5}$). Finally, Habilis-$β$ achieves the highest reported performance on the standard RoboTwin 2.0 leaderboard across representative tasks, validating its effectiveness in complex manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, aerial platforms have evolved from passive flying sensors into versatile, contact-aware robotic systems, leading to rapid advances in platform design. Standard coplanar and collinear quadrotors have been complemented by modern tilted and tilting multi-rotor platforms with enhanced maneuverability. To properly analyze, control, and validate the performance of these emerging platforms, an accurate modeling step is required; however, this can be time-consuming, user-dependent and error-prone. To address this issue, we propose a MATLAB/Simulink toolbox for modeling and simulating the dynamics of a broad class of multi-rotor platforms through both an analytical and physics-based approaches. The toolbox, named RotorSuite, is provided with comprehensive documentation and example use cases, representing a valuable tool for didactic, research, and industrial development purposes.

TL;DR: GRAB是一个全面的抓取基准框架，用于评估机器人抓取食品废弃物中无机污染物的性能，通过大规模实验揭示了不同抓取器的优缺点和关键影响因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品废弃物管理对可持续发展至关重要，但无机污染物阻碍了回收潜力。机器人自动化通过自动去除污染物加速分拣过程，然而污染物的多样性和不可预测性给机器人抓取带来重大挑战。现有基准框架依赖有限的模拟数据集，优先考虑简单的成功率指标，忽视了关键的物体和环境相关的预抓取条件。

Result: 大规模评估揭示了不同抓取器的明显优势和局限性。在杂乱环境中，物体质量成为主导性能因素，而视觉质量和杂乱程度起中等作用。结果强调了物体质量对抓取性能的关键影响。

Conclusion: 这些发现突出了重要的设计考虑因素，并强调了开发能够实现稳健跨类别性能的多模态抓取器技术的必要性，以实现有效的机器人食品废弃物分拣。

Abstract: Food waste management is critical for sustainability, yet inorganic contaminants hinder recycling potential. Robotic automation presents a compelling approach to this challenge by accelerating the sorting process through automated contaminant removal. Still, the diverse and unpredictable nature of contaminants creates major challenges for robotic grasping. Benchmarking frameworks are critical for evaluating challenges from various perspectives. However, existing protocols rely on limited simulation datasets, prioritise simple metrics such as success rate, and overlook key object and environment-related pre-grasp conditions. This paper introduces GRAB, a comprehensive Grasping Real-World Article Benchmarking framework that addresses this gap by integrating diverse deformable objects, advanced grasp-pose-estimation vision, and, importantly, pre-grasp conditions, establishing a set of critical graspability metrics. It systematically compares industrial grasping modalities through an in-depth experimental evaluation involving 1,750 food contaminant grasp attempts across four high-fidelity scenes. This large-scale evaluation provides an extensive assessment of grasp performance for food waste sorting, offering a level of depth that has rarely been explored in previous studies. The results reveal distinct gripper strengths and limitations, with object quality emerging as the dominant performance factor in cluttered environments, while vision quality and clutter levels play moderate roles. These findings highlight essential design considerations and reinforce the necessity of developing multimodal gripper technologies capable of robust cross-category performance for effective robotic food waste sorting.

*J. E. Domínguez-Vidal,Alberto Sanfeliu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该研究比较了四种人机协作通信系统：两种意图预测模型（基于力预测和增强速度预测）和两种显式通信方法（按钮界面和语音命令系统），在移动社交机器人IVO上进行物体运输任务测试。结果显示：1）性能足够后用户不再感知技术改进；2）用户偏好更自然的系统，即使失败率更高；3）预测与显式通信的最佳组合最受欢迎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类行为的随机性导致意图预测模型存在不确定性，研究者开始倡导使用显式通信系统来明确获取人类意图。本研究旨在比较意图预测和显式通信系统在人机协作物体运输任务中的表现，探索最佳的人机交互方式。

Method: 使用定制移动社交机器人IVO，配备力传感器检测人机间力交换，LiDAR检测环境。比较四种通信系统：两种意图预测（力预测和增强速度预测算法）和两种显式通信（按钮界面和语音命令识别）。75名志愿者完成255次实验，分为三组：第一轮测试推理系统，第二轮测试通信系统，第三轮测试组合策略。任务是在5-7米距离内运输物体，中间有障碍物。

Result: 1）一旦系统性能达到足够水平，用户不再注意到技术改进，但会给予积极评价；2）用户偏好更自然的系统（如语音命令），即使这些系统有更高的失败率；3）最受欢迎的选项是意图预测和显式通信系统的恰当组合。

Conclusion: 在人机协作任务中，单纯追求技术性能提升可能不会带来用户体验的显著改善。用户更看重交互的自然性，而最佳的人机交互策略应该是意图预测和显式通信系统的智能结合，既能利用预测的效率优势，又能通过显式通信确保可靠性。

Abstract: Although in the literature it is common to find predictors and inference systems that try to predict human intentions, the uncertainty of these models due to the randomness of human behavior has led some authors to start advocating the use of communication systems that explicitly elicit human intention. In this work, it is analyzed the use of four different communication systems with a human-robot collaborative object transportation task as experimental testbed: two intention predictors (one based on force prediction and another with an enhanced velocity prediction algorithm) and two explicit communication methods (a button interface and a voice-command recognition system). These systems were integrated into IVO, a custom mobile social robot equipped with force sensor to detect the force exchange between both agents and LiDAR to detect the environment. The collaborative task required transporting an object over a 5-7 meter distance with obstacles in the middle, demanding rapid decisions and precise physical coordination. 75 volunteers perform a total of 255 executions divided into three groups, testing inference systems in the first round, communication systems in the second, and the combined strategies in the third. The results show that, 1) once sufficient performance is achieved, the human no longer notices and positively assesses technical improvements; 2) the human prefers systems that are more natural to them even though they have higher failure rates; and 3) the preferred option is the right combination of both systems.

*Yifei Yuan,Ghaith Androwis,Xianlian Zhou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究开发了基于强化学习的肌肉骨骼仿真框架，用于量化单侧肌肉无力对步态对称性的影响，并评估踝关节外骨骼辅助在受损条件下的改善效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单侧肌肉无力常导致不对称步态，破坏肢体间协调和站立时间。本研究旨在建立基于仿真和学习的流程，支持在患者实验前进行早期控制器开发。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）的肌肉骨骼仿真框架，通过将右腿肌肉力量减少到基线水平的75%、50%和25%来诱导不对称步态。使用离地时间、峰值接触力和关节级对称性指标量化步态不对称性，并评估踝关节外骨骼辅助效果。

Result: 肌肉无力增加导致时间和运动学不对称性逐渐增大，踝关节最为明显。踝关节活动范围对称性从100%力量时的近对称行为（SI=+6.4%；r=0.974）恶化到25%力量时的严重不对称（SI=-47.1%，r=0.889）。在50%力量时，踝关节外骨骼辅助改善了运动学对称性，将踝关节SI从25.8%降低到18.5%，相关性从r=0.948提高到0.966。

Conclusion: 该框架支持对损伤严重程度和辅助策略进行受控评估，为未来在人体实验中的验证提供了基础。

Abstract: Unilateral muscle weakness often leads to asymmetric gait, disrupting interlimb coordination and stance timing. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based musculoskeletal simulation framework to (1) quantify how progressive unilateral muscle weakness affects gait symmetry and (2) evaluate whether ankle exoskeleton assistance can improve gait symmetry under impaired conditions. The overarching goal is to establish a simulation- and learning-based workflow that supports early controller development prior to patient experiments. Asymmetric gait was induced by reducing right-leg muscle strength to 75%, 50%, and 25% of baseline. Gait asymmetry was quantified using toe-off timing, peak contact forces, and joint-level symmetry metrics. Increasing weakness produced progressively larger temporal and kinematic asymmetry, most pronounced at the ankle. Ankle range of motion symmetry degraded from near-symmetric behavior at 100% strength (symmetry index, SI = +6.4%; correlation r=0.974) to severe asymmetry at 25% strength (SI = -47.1%, r=0.889), accompanied by a load shift toward the unimpaired limb. At 50% strength, ankle exoskeleton assistance improved kinematic symmetry relative to the unassisted impaired condition, reducing the magnitude of ankle SI from 25.8% to 18.5% and increasing ankle correlation from r=0.948 to 0.966, although peak loading remained biased toward the unimpaired side. Overall, this framework supports controlled evaluation of impairment severity and assistive strategies, and provides a basis for future validation in human experiments.

*Tatiana Berlenko,Kirill Krinkin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于pignistic变换的方法，用于公平比较贝叶斯对数赔率与Dempster组合规则在占据栅格地图中的应用，通过匹配每观测决策概率来隔离融合规则与传感器参数化的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要一种公平的方法来比较贝叶斯融合和信念函数融合在占据栅格地图中的性能，避免传感器参数化对比较结果的影响。

Method: 采用pignistic变换为基础的方法论，匹配每观测决策概率来隔离融合规则的影响。在BetP匹配下，通过仿真、两个真实激光雷达数据集和下游路径规划进行评估。

Result: 在BetP匹配下，贝叶斯融合始终表现更优（15/15方向一致性，p = 3.1e-5），绝对差异较小（0.001-0.022）。在归一化似真性匹配下，结果方向反转，表明结果依赖于匹配准则。

Conclusion: 该方法论可重复用于未来任何贝叶斯/信念函数的比较，为公平评估不同融合规则提供了可重用框架。

Abstract: We introduce a pignistic-transform-based methodology for fair comparison of Bayesian log-odds and Dempster's combination rule in occupancy grid mapping, matching per-observation decision probabilities to isolate the fusion rule from sensor parameterization. Under BetP matching across simulation, two real lidar datasets, and downstream path planning, Bayesian fusion is consistently favored (15/15 directional consistency, p = 3.1e-5) with small absolute differences (0.001-0.022). Under normalized plausibility matching, the direction reverses, confirming the result is matching-criterion-specific. The methodology is reusable for any future Bayesian/belief function comparison.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在未知环境中，机器人需要满足时空逻辑规范，但期望标签的确切位置事先未知。传统方法难以处理这种不确定性，特别是当某些动作具有不可逆后果时，可能永久排除某些满足规范的可能性。

Method: 引入"承诺状态"概念来捕捉不可逆动作导致的中间任务进展；提出基于前沿的探索算法，该算法在引导机器人向任务进展的同时，保留所有可能的满足方式；算法具有完备性和可靠性。

Result: 通过仿真验证了所提方法的有效性，表明该方法能够在未知环境中成功指导机器人满足scLTL规范，同时处理不可逆动作带来的约束。

Conclusion: 该方法通过承诺状态和前沿探索策略，为未知环境中具有不可逆动作的时空逻辑运动规划提供了有效的解决方案，能够在保证任务完成可能性的同时推进任务进展。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of temporal logic motion planning for an autonomous robot operating in an unknown environment. The objective is to enable the robot to satisfy a syntactically co-safe Linear Temporal Logic (scLTL) specification when the exact locations of the desired labels are not known a priori. We introduce a new type of automaton state, referred to as commit states. These states capture intermediate task progress resulting from actions whose consequences are irreversible. In other words, certain future paths to satisfaction become not feasible after taking those actions that lead to the commit states. By leveraging commit states, we propose a sound and complete frontier-based exploration algorithm that strategically guides the robot to make progress toward the task while preserving all possible ways of satisfying it. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated through simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确感知物体硬度对于安全灵巧的接触式机器人操作至关重要，需要结合触觉传感和上下文理解。

Method: 融合GelSight-Mini触觉流、RGB观测和语言提示；使用ResNet50+LSTM模型从序列触觉数据估计硬度；跨模态对齐模块结合视觉线索和大语言模型指导；比较YOLO和Grounded-SAM进行接触点选择；轻量级LLM解析用户指令并生成可解释的自然语言输出。

Conclusion: 结合预训练视觉触觉模型与语言基础化，有望推进机器人中可解释、类人的触觉感知和决策制定。

Abstract: Accurate perception of object hardness is essential for safe and dexterous contact-rich robotic manipulation. Here, we present TactEx, an explainable multimodal robotic interaction framework that unifies vision, touch, and language for human-like hardness estimation and interactive guidance. We evaluate TactEx on fruit-ripeness assessment, a representative task that requires both tactile sensing and contextual understanding. The system fuses GelSight-Mini tactile streams with RGB observations and language prompts. A ResNet50+LSTM model estimates hardness from sequential tactile data, while a cross-modal alignment module combines visual cues with guidance from a large language model (LLM). This explainable multimodal interface allows users to distinguish ripeness levels with statistically significant class separation (p < 0.01 for all fruit pairs). For touch placement, we compare YOLO with Grounded-SAM (GSAM) and find GSAM to be more robust for fine-grained segmentation and contact-site selection. A lightweight LLM parses user instructions and produces grounded natural-language explanations linked to the tactile outputs. In end-to-end evaluations, TactEx attains 90% task success on simple user queries and generalises to novel tasks without large-scale tuning. These results highlight the promise of combining pretrained visual and tactile models with language grounding to advance explainable, human-like touch perception and decision-making in robotics.

TL;DR: 无人机平台配备弹性触角，通过"触碰即走"机动实现与环境的被动物理交互，利用弹性触角吸收冲击能量并保持稳定性，无需主动避障控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空中机器人正从避免障碍物转向利用环境接触交互进行导航、探索和操作。关键挑战在于处理未知目标上的不确定接触力，这通常需要精确传感和主动控制。

Method: 提出配备弹性触角的无人机平台，实现"触碰即走"机动 - 一种自我调节的连续碰撞运动。利用环境交互作为体现控制形式，通过无人机-障碍物系统的被动动态响应（类似质量-弹簧-阻尼系统）实现低层稳定和近障碍物导航。

Result: 实验显示弹性触角能吸收冲击能量同时保持飞行器稳定性，与刚性触角配置相比减少38%的俯仰振荡。下部触角布置进一步减少约54%的俯仰振荡。平台还能实现与静态物体的稳定持续接触，仅依赖标准姿态PID控制器。

Conclusion: 弹性触角无人机平台通过被动动态响应实现环境物理交互，减少对主动避障控制的依赖，为空中机器人的接触式导航和操作提供了新方法。

Abstract: Aerial robots are evolving from avoiding obstacles to exploiting the environmental contact interactions for navigation, exploration and manipulation. A key challenge in such aerial physical interactions lies in handling uncertain contact forces on unknown targets, which typically demand accurate sensing and active control. We present a drone platform with elastic horns that enables touch-and-go manoeuvres - a self-regulated, consecutive bumping motion that allows the drone to maintain proximity to a wall without relying on active obstacle avoidance. It leverages environmental interaction as a form of embodied control, where low-level stabilisation and near-obstacle navigation emerge from the passive dynamic responses of the drone-obstacle system that resembles a mass-spring-damper system. Experiments show that the elastic horn can absorb impact energy while maintaining vehicle stability, reducing pitch oscillations by 38% compared to the rigid horn configuration. The lower horn arrangement was found to reduce pitch oscillations by approximately 54%. In addition to intermittent contact, the platform equipped with elastic horns also demonstrates stable, sustained contact with static objects, relying on a standard attitude PID controller.

Abstract: The automation of fruit harvesting has gained increasing significance in response to rising labor shortages. A sensorized gripper is a key component of this process, which must be compact enough for confined spaces, able to stably grasp diverse fruits, and provide reliable feedback on fruit conditions for efficient harvesting.

This configuration accommodates a wide range of fruit sizes while maintaining low cost and mechanical simplicity. Tactile images captured by an embedded camera provide rich information for real-time force estimation, slip detection, and softness prediction. We validate the gripper in real-world fruit harvesting experiments, demonstrating robust grasp stability and effective damage prevention.

Abstract: Many of the challenges encountered in in-the-wild public deployments of robots remain undocumented despite sharing many common pitfalls. This creates a high barrier of entry and results in repetition of avoidable mistakes. To articulate the tacit knowledge in the HRI community, this paper presents a guideline in the form of a checklist to support researchers in preparing for robot deployments in public. Drawing on their own experience with public robot deployments, the research team collected essential topics to consider in public HRI research. These topics are represented as modular flip cards in a hierarchical table, structured into deployment phases and important domains. We interviewed six interdisciplinary researchers with expertise in public HRI and show how including community input refines the checklist. We further show the checklist in action in context of real public studies. Finally, we contribute the checklist as an open-source, customizable community resource that both collects joint expertise for continual evolution and is usable as a list, set of cards, and an interactive web tool.

Abstract: Path planning for high-speed unmanned surface vehicles requires more complex solutions to reduce sailing time and save energy. This article proposes a new predictive artificial potential field that incorporates time information and predictive potential to plan smoother paths. It explores the principles of the artificial potential field, considering vehicle dynamics and local minimum reachability. The study first analyzes the most advanced traditional artificial potential field and its drawbacks in global and local path planning. It then introduces three modifications to the predictive artificial potential field-angle limit, velocity adjustment, and predictive potential to enhance the feasibility and flatness of the generated path. A comparison between the traditional and predictive artificial potential fields demonstrates that the latter successfully restricts the maximum turning angle, shortens sailing time, and intelligently avoids obstacles. Simulation results further verify that the predictive artificial potential field addresses the concave local minimum problem and improves reachability in special scenarios, ultimately generating a more efficient path that reduces sailing time and conserves energy for unmanned surface vehicles.

Abstract: Robotaxis are emerging as a promising form of urban mobility, yet research has largely emphasized technical driving performance while leaving open how passengers experience and evaluate rides without a human driver. To address the limitations of prior work that often relies on simulated or hypothetical settings, we investigate real-world robotaxi use through 18 semi-structured interviews and autoethnographic ride experiences. We found that users were drawn to robotaxis by low cost, social recommendation, and curiosity. They valued a distinctive set of benefits, such as an increased sense of agency, and consistent driving behavioral consistency and standardized ride experiences. However, they encountered persistent challenges around limited flexibility, insufficient transparency, management difficulty, robustness concerns in edge cases, and emergency handling concerns. Robotaxi experiences were shaped by privacy, safety, ethics, and trust. Users were often privacy-indifferent yet sensitive to opaque access and leakage risks; safety perceptions were polarized; and ethical considerations surfaced round issues such as accountability, feedback responsibility and absence of human-like social norms. Based on these findings, we propose a user-driven design framework spanning the end-to-end journey, such as pre-ride configuration (hailing), context-aware pickup facilitation (pick-up) in-ride explainability (traveling), and accountable post-ride feedback (drop-off) to guide robotaxi interaction and service design.

Abstract: Safely moving through environments affected by fire is a critical capability for autonomous mobile robots deployed in disaster response. In this work, we present a novel approach for mobile robots to understand fire through building real-time thermal radiation fields. We register depth and thermal images to obtain a 3D point cloud annotated with temperature values. From these data, we identify fires and use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to approximate the thermal radiation in empty spaces. This enables the construction of a continuous thermal radiation field over the environment. We show that this representation can be used for robot navigation, where we embed thermal constraints into the cost map to compute collision-free and thermally safe paths. We validate our approach on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot in controlled experimental settings. Our experiments demonstrate the robot's ability to avoid hazardous regions while still reaching navigation goals. Our approach paves the way toward mobile robots that can be autonomously deployed in fire-affected environments, with potential applications in search-and-rescue, firefighting, and hazardous material response.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出分布式协作视觉-惯性-测距里程计框架，通过多机器人协作融合VIO和UWB测量，实现GPS拒止环境下的可靠定位和锚点自校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GPS拒止环境中，多机器人系统需要可靠定位。VIO虽然轻量准确但存在累积漂移，UWB提供全局观测但现有方法多为单机器人且依赖预校准锚点，限制了实际鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DC-VIRO框架，将VIO和UWB测量在多机器人间紧密融合。将锚点位置显式纳入系统状态以处理校准不确定性，通过机器人间通信共享锚点观测提供额外几何约束，采用李群上的右不变误差公式保持VIO可观测性。

Result: 多机器人仿真结果表明，DC-VIRO显著提高了定位精度和鲁棒性，同时在分布式设置中实现了锚点自校准。

Conclusion: DC-VIRO框架通过分布式协作融合VIO和UWB，解决了GPS拒止环境下多机器人定位的累积漂移和锚点校准问题，提高了系统的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reliable localization is a fundamental requirement for multi-robot systems operating in GPS-denied environments. Visual-inertial odometry (VIO) provides lightweight and accurate motion estimation but suffers from cumulative drift in the absence of global references. Ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging offers complementary global observations, yet most existing UWB-aided VIO methods are designed for single-robot scenarios and rely on pre-calibrated anchors, which limits their robustness in practice. This paper proposes a distributed collaborative visual-inertial-ranging odometry (DC-VIRO) framework that tightly fuses VIO and UWB measurements across multiple robots. Anchor positions are explicitly included in the system state to address calibration uncertainty, while shared anchor observations are exploited through inter-robot communication to provide additional geometric constraints. By leveraging a right-invariant error formulation on Lie groups, the proposed approach preserves the observability properties of standard VIO, ensuring estimator consistency. Simulation results with multiple robots demonstrate that DC-VIRO significantly improves localization accuracy and robustness, while simultaneously enabling anchor self-calibration in distributed settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了流形上的高斯推断稳定性，推导了投影边缘化和曲面测度条件化的非渐近W2稳定性界，分离了几何失真与尾部泄漏效应，为流形推断提供了实用的诊断指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人学中，光滑流形上的高斯推断是核心问题，但精确的边缘化和条件化通常是非高斯的且依赖于几何结构。现有方法缺乏对线性化高斯推断稳定性的理论保证，需要明确的诊断指标来确定何时从单图线性化切换到多图或基于采样的推断方法。

Method: 研究切空间线性化高斯推断，推导投影边缘化和曲面测度条件化的非渐近W2稳定性界。这些界限分离了局部二阶几何失真和非局部尾部泄漏效应。对于高斯输入，从均值、协方差矩阵以及曲率/可达性替代量得到闭式诊断指标。

Result: 在圆和平面推动实验中验证了预测的校准转换点约为√‖Σ‖op/R≈1/6。结果表明当局部性破坏时，法向不确定性是主要的失效模式。这些诊断指标为从单图线性化切换到多图或基于采样的流形推断提供了实用触发器。

Conclusion: 该研究为流形上的高斯推断提供了理论稳定性保证和实用诊断工具，分离了几何失真与尾部泄漏效应，能够有效指导实际应用中推断方法的选择，提高机器人系统中流形推断的可靠性和精度。

Abstract: Gaussian inference on smooth manifolds is central to robotics, but exact marginalization and conditioning are generally non-Gaussian and geometry-dependent. We study tangent-linearized Gaussian inference and derive explicit non-asymptotic $W_2$ stability bounds for projection marginalization and surface-measure conditioning. The bounds separate local second-order geometric distortion from nonlocal tail leakage and, for Gaussian inputs, yield closed-form diagnostics from $(μ,Σ)$ and curvature/reach surrogates. Circle and planar-pushing experiments validate the predicted calibration transition near $\sqrt{\|Σ\|_{\mathrm{op}}}/R\approx 1/6$ and indicate that normal-direction uncertainty is the dominant failure mode when locality breaks. These diagnostics provide practical triggers for switching from single-chart linearization to multi-chart or sample-based manifold inference.

Conclusion: 提出的统一推动策略通过提示机制实现了高效、通用的推动操作，可作为灵活的低级原语集成到高级规划系统中

Abstract: As one of the simplest non-prehensile manipulation skills, pushing has been widely studied as an effective means to rearrange objects. Existing approaches, however, typically rely on multi-step push plans composed of pre-defined pushing primitives with limited application scopes, which restrict their efficiency and versatility across different scenarios. In this work, we propose a unified pushing policy that incorporates a lightweight prompting mechanism into a flow matching policy to guide the generation of reactive, multimodal pushing actions. The visual prompt can be specified by a high-level planner, enabling the reuse of the pushing policy across a wide range of planning problems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified pushing policy not only outperforms existing baselines but also effectively serves as a low-level primitive within a VLM-guided planning framework to solve table-cleaning tasks efficiently.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently been proposed as a pathway toward generalist robotic policies capable of interpreting natural language and visual inputs to generate manipulation actions. However, their effectiveness and efficiency on structured, long-horizon manipulation tasks remain unclear. In this work, we present a head-to-head empirical comparison between a fine-tuned open-weight VLA model π0 and a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines PDDL-based symbolic planning with learned low-level control. We evaluate both approaches on structured variants of the Towers of Hanoi manipulation task in simulation while measuring both task performance and energy consumption during training and execution. On the 3-block task, the neuro-symbolic model achieves 95% success compared to 34% for the best-performing VLA. The neuro-symbolic model also generalizes to an unseen 4-block variant (78% success), whereas both VLAs fail to complete the task. During training, VLA fine-tuning consumes nearly two orders of magnitude more energy than the neuro-symbolic approach. These results highlight important trade-offs between end-to-end foundation-model approaches and structured reasoning architectures for long-horizon robotic manipulation, emphasizing the role of explicit symbolic structure in improving reliability, data efficiency, and energy efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel vision-based control algorithm for regulating the whole body shape of extensible multisection soft continuum manipulators. Contrary to existing vision-based control algorithms in the literature that regulate the robot's end effector pose, our proposed control algorithm regulates the robot's whole body configuration, enabling us to leverage its kinematic redundancy. Additionally, our model-based 2.5D shape visual servoing provides globally stable asymptotic convergence in the robot's 3D workspace compared to the closest works in the literature that report local minima. Unlike existing visual servoing algorithms in the literature, our approach does not require information from proprioceptive sensors, making it suitable for continuum manipulators without such capabilities. Instead, robot state is estimated from images acquired by an external camera that observes the robot's whole body shape and is also utilized to close the shape control loop. Traditionally, visual servoing schemes require an image of the robot at its reference pose to generate the reference features. In this work, we utilize an inverse kinematics solver to generate reference features for the desired robot configuration and do not require images of the robot at the reference. Experiments are performed on a multisection continuum manipulator demonstrating the controller's capability to regulate the robot's whole body shape while precisely positioning the robot's end effector. Results validate our controller's ability to regulate the shape of continuum robots while demonstrating a smooth transient response and a steady-state error within 1 mm. Proof-of-concept object manipulation experiments including stacking, pouring, and pulling tasks are performed to demonstrate our controller's applicability.

Conclusion: VLM路径编辑程序合成与基于模型规划安全的结合，使机器人能够在保持安全性和可解释性的同时实现开放式协作，为去中心化智能体间的安全协作提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Successful cooperation among decentralized agents requires each agent to quickly adapt its plan to the behavior of other agents. In scenarios where agents cannot confidently predict one another's intentions and plans, language communication can be crucial for ensuring safety. In this work, we focus on path-level cooperation in which agents must adapt their paths to one another in order to avoid collisions or perform physical collaboration such as joint carrying. In particular, we propose a safe and interpretable multimodal path planning method, CaPE (Code as Path Editor), which generates and updates path plans for an agent based on the environment and language communication from other agents. CaPE leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to synthesize a path editing program verified by a model-based planner, grounding communication to path plan updates in a safe and interpretable way. We evaluate our approach in diverse simulated and real-world scenarios, including multi-robot and human-robot cooperation in autonomous driving, household, and joint carrying tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPE can be integrated into different robotic systems as a plug-and-play module, greatly enhancing a robot's ability to align its plan to language communication from other robots or humans. We also show that the combination of the VLM-based path editing program synthesis and model-based planning safety enables robots to achieve open-ended cooperation while maintaining safety and interpretability.

TL;DR: WildOS是一个用于长距离开放词汇目标搜索的统一系统，结合了安全几何探索与语义视觉推理，在复杂无结构户外环境中实现鲁棒导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂无结构的户外环境中，机器人需要在没有先验地图和有限深度感知的情况下进行长距离操作。仅依赖几何前沿进行探索往往不足，需要语义推理能力来确定安全可通行区域和导航方向。

Conclusion: WildOS展示了视觉基础模型驱动开放世界机器人行为的潜力，这些行为既具有语义信息又基于几何基础，为复杂户外环境中的自主导航提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in complex, unstructured outdoor environments requires robots to operate over long ranges without prior maps and limited depth sensing. In such settings, relying solely on geometric frontiers for exploration is often insufficient. In such settings, the ability to reason semantically about where to go and what is safe to traverse is crucial for robust, efficient exploration. This work presents WildOS, a unified system for long-range, open-vocabulary object search that combines safe geometric exploration with semantic visual reasoning. WildOS builds a sparse navigation graph to maintain spatial memory, while utilizing a foundation-model-based vision module, ExploRFM, to score frontier nodes of the graph. ExploRFM simultaneously predicts traversability, visual frontiers, and object similarity in image space, enabling real-time, onboard semantic navigation tasks. The resulting vision-scored graph enables the robot to explore semantically meaningful directions while ensuring geometric safety. Furthermore, we introduce a particle-filter-based method for coarse localization of the open-vocabulary target query, that estimates candidate goal positions beyond the robot's immediate depth horizon, enabling effective planning toward distant goals. Extensive closed-loop field experiments across diverse off-road and urban terrains demonstrate that WildOS enables robust navigation, significantly outperforming purely geometric and purely vision-based baselines in both efficiency and autonomy. Our results highlight the potential of vision foundation models to drive open-world robotic behaviors that are both semantically informed and geometrically grounded.

Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型在强化学习中面临样本效率低和现实世界奖励稀疏的问题，需要开发能够提供细粒度反馈的通用过程奖励模型。现有时间价值函数往往无法泛化到训练域之外。

Method: TOPReward是一种概率基础的时间价值函数，直接从预训练视频视觉语言模型的内部token对数中提取任务进度，而不是像先前方法那样提示VLM直接输出进度值。

Result: 在130多个不同的现实世界任务和多个机器人平台上进行零样本评估，TOPReward在Qwen3-VL上实现了0.947的平均价值顺序相关性，显著优于最先进的GVL基线方法。

Conclusion: TOPReward作为一种多功能工具，可用于下游应用，包括成功检测和奖励对齐的行为克隆，为解决视觉-语言-动作模型在强化学习中的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have seen rapid progress in pretraining, their advancement in Reinforcement Learning (RL) remains hampered by low sample efficiency and sparse rewards in real-world settings. Developing generalizable process reward models is essential for providing the fine-grained feedback necessary to bridge this gap, yet existing temporal value functions often fail to generalize beyond their training domains. We introduce TOPReward, a novel, probabilistically grounded temporal value function that leverages the latent world knowledge of pretrained video Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate robotic task progress. Unlike prior methods that prompt VLMs to directly output progress values, which are prone to numerical misrepresentation, TOPReward extracts task progress directly from the VLM's internal token logits. In zero-shot evaluations across 130+ distinct real-world tasks and multiple robot platforms (e.g., Franka, YAM, SO-100/101), TOPReward achieves 0.947 mean Value-Order Correlation (VOC) on Qwen3-VL, dramatically outperforming the state-of-the-art GVL baseline which achieves near-zero correlation on the same open-source model. We further demonstrate that TOPReward serves as a versatile tool for downstream applications, including success detection and reward-aligned behavior cloning.

Abstract: Underwater glider robots have become an indispensable tool for ocean sampling. Although stakeholders are calling for tools to manage increasingly large fleets of gliders, successful autonomous long-term deployments have thus far been scarce, which hints at a lack of suitable methodologies and systems. In this work, we formulate glider navigation planning as a stochastic shortest-path Markov Decision Process and propose a sample-based online planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. Samples are generated by a physics-informed simulator that captures uncertain execution of controls and ocean current forecasts while remaining computationally tractable. The simulator parameters are fitted using historical glider data. We integrate these methods into an autonomous command-and-control system for Slocum gliders that enables closed-loop replanning at each surfacing. The resulting system was validated in two field deployments in the North Sea totalling approximately 3 months and 1000 km of autonomous operation. Results demonstrate improved efficiency compared to straight-to-goal navigation and show the practicality of sample-based planning for long-term marine autonomy.

Abstract: Modular small-scale robots offer the potential for on-demand assembly and disassembly, enabling task-specific adaptation in dynamic and constrained environments. However, existing modular magnetic platforms often depend on workspace collisions for reconfiguration, employ bulky three-dimensional electromagnetic systems, and lack robust single-module control, which limits their applicability in biomedical settings. In this work, we present a modular magnetic millirobotic platform comprising three cube-shaped modules with embedded permanent magnets, each designed for a distinct functional role: a free module that supports self-assembly and reconfiguration, a fixed module that enables flip-and-walk locomotion, and a gripper module for cargo manipulation. Locomotion and reconfiguration are actuated by programmable combinations of time-varying two-dimensional uniform and gradient magnetic field inputs. Experiments demonstrate closed-loop navigation using real-time vision feedback and A* path planning, establishing robust single-module control capabilities. Beyond locomotion, the system achieves self-assembly, multimodal transformations, and disassembly at low field strengths. Chain-to-gripper transformations succeeded in 90% of trials, while chain-to-square transformations were less consistent, underscoring the role of module geometry in reconfiguration reliability. These results establish a versatile modular robotic platform capable of multimodal behavior and robust control, suggesting a promising pathway toward scalable and adaptive task execution in confined environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人仿真器物理参数（摩擦、阻尼、材料刚度）校准通常手动完成或使用黑盒优化器，这些方法能减少误差但无法解释哪些物理差异导致误差。当感知仅限于外部相机时，问题进一步复杂化，存在感知噪声且缺乏直接的力或状态测量。

Method: 提出Vid2Sid系统识别管道，结合基础模型感知和VLM循环优化器，分析配对仿真-真实视频，诊断具体不匹配，并通过自然语言推理提出物理参数更新。在肌腱驱动手指（MuJoCo刚体动力学）和可变形连续触手（PyElastica软体动力学）上评估。

Result: 在训练期间未见过的sim2real保留控制任务上，Vid2Sid在所有设置中达到最佳平均排名，匹配或超过黑盒优化器，同时独特地提供每次迭代的可解释推理。Sim2sim验证显示Vid2Sid最准确地恢复真实参数（平均相对误差低于13% vs. 28-98%）。消融分析揭示了三种校准机制。

Conclusion: 当感知清晰且仿真器表达能力足够时，VLM引导的优化表现出色，而模型类别限制在更具挑战性的设置中限制了性能。该方法在保持可解释性的同时实现了准确的物理参数校准。

Abstract: Calibrating a robot simulator's physics parameters (friction, damping, material stiffness) to match real hardware is often done by hand or with black-box optimizers that reduce error but cannot explain which physical discrepancies drive the error. When sensing is limited to external cameras, the problem is further compounded by perception noise and the absence of direct force or state measurements. We present Vid2Sid, a video-driven system identification pipeline that couples foundation-model perception with a VLM-in-the-loop optimizer that analyzes paired sim-real videos, diagnoses concrete mismatches, and proposes physics parameter updates with natural language rationales. We evaluate our approach on a tendon-actuated finger (rigid-body dynamics in MuJoCo) and a deformable continuum tentacle (soft-body dynamics in PyElastica). On sim2real holdout controls unseen during training, Vid2Sid achieves the best average rank across all settings, matching or exceeding black-box optimizers while uniquely providing interpretable reasoning at each iteration. Sim2sim validation confirms that Vid2Sid recovers ground-truth parameters most accurately (mean relative error under 13\% vs. 28--98\%), and ablation analysis reveals three calibration regimes. VLM-guided optimization excels when perception is clean and the simulator is expressive, while model-class limitations bound performance in more challenging settings.

Abstract: Solving complex, long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks requires a deep understanding of physical interactions, reasoning about their long-term consequences, and precise high-level planning. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a general perceive-reason-act framework for this goal. However, previous approaches using reflective planning to guide VLMs in correcting actions encounter significant limitations. These methods rely on inefficient and often inaccurate implicit learning of state-values from noisy foresight predictions, evaluate only a single greedy future, and suffer from substantial inference latency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel test-time computation framework that decouples state evaluation from action generation. This provides a more direct and fine-grained supervisory signal for robust decision-making. Our method explicitly models the advantage of an action plan, quantified by its reduction in distance to the goal, and uses a scalable critic to estimate. To address the stochastic nature of single-trajectory evaluation, we employ beam search to explore multiple future paths and aggregate them during decoding to model their expected long-term returns, leading to more robust action generation. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight, confidence-based trigger that allows for early exit when direct predictions are reliable, invoking reflection only when necessary.

<details>

Motivation: 解决多机器人在稀疏奖励环境中探索效率低、冗余度高的问题，同时为资源受限的机器人提供可行的轨迹规划方案

Method: 将希尔伯特空间填充先验集成到DQN和PPO算法中，使用希尔伯特空间索引结构化探索过程；开发航点接口将希尔伯特排序转换为曲率受限、时间参数化的SE(2)轨迹（平面(x, y, θ)）

Result: 在多机器人网格覆盖任务中，相比DQN/PPO基线方法，覆盖效率、冗余度和收敛速度均有提升；在波士顿动力Spot腿式机器人上的验证显示，室内环境中能够可靠执行生成轨迹，冗余度低

Conclusion: 几何先验能够提升群体机器人和腿式机器人的自主性和可扩展性，希尔伯特空间填充先验为多机器人覆盖任务提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: We present a coverage framework that integrates Hilbert space-filling priors into decentralized multi-robot learning and execution. We augment DQN and PPO with Hilbert-based spatial indices to structure exploration and reduce redundancy in sparse-reward environments, and we evaluate scalability in multi-robot grid coverage. We further describe a waypoint interface that converts Hilbert orderings into curvature-bounded, time-parameterized SE(2) trajectories (planar (x, y, θ)), enabling onboard feasibility on resource-constrained robots. Experiments show improvements in coverage efficiency, redundancy, and convergence speed over DQN/PPO baselines. In addition, we validate the approach on a Boston Dynamics Spot legged robot, executing the generated trajectories in indoor environments and observing reliable coverage with low redundancy. These results indicate that geometric priors improve autonomy and scalability for swarm and legged robotics.

Abstract: Anticipating and adapting to failures is a key capability robots need to collaborate effectively with humans in complex domains. This continues to be a challenge despite the impressive performance of state of the art AI planning systems and Large Language Models (LLMs) because of the uncertainty associated with the tasks and their outcomes. Toward addressing this challenge, we present a hybrid framework that integrates the generic prediction capabilities of an LLM with the probabilistic sequential decision-making capability of Relational Dynamic Influence Diagram Language. For any given task, the robot reasons about the task and the capabilities of the human attempting to complete it; predicts potential failures due to lack of ability (in the human) or lack of relevant domain objects; and executes actions to prevent such failures or recover from them. Experimental evaluation in the VirtualHome 3D simulation environment demonstrates substantial improvement in performance compared with state of the art baselines.

Abstract: Active search for recovering objects of interest through online, adaptive decision making with autonomous agents requires trading off exploration of unknown environments with exploitation of prior observations in the search space. Prior work has proposed information gain and Thompson sampling based myopic, greedy approaches for agents to actively decide query or search locations when the number of targets is unknown. Decision making algorithms in such partially observable environments have also shown that agents capable of lookahead over a finite horizon outperform myopic policies for active search. Unfortunately, lookahead algorithms typically rely on building a computationally expensive search tree that is simulated and updated based on the agent's observations and a model of the environment dynamics. Instead, in this work, we leverage the sequence modeling abilities of diffusion models to sample lookahead action sequences that balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off for active search without building an exhaustive search tree. We identify the optimism bias in prior diffusion based reinforcement learning approaches when applied to the active search setting and propose mitigating solutions for efficient cost-aware decision making with both single and multi-agent teams. Our proposed algorithm outperforms standard baselines in offline reinforcement learning in terms of full recovery rate and is computationally more efficient than tree search in cost-aware active decision making.

Abstract: Autonomous odor source localization remains a challenging problem for aerial robots due to turbulent airflow, sparse and delayed sensory signals, and strict payload and compute constraints. While prior unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based olfaction systems have demonstrated gas distribution mapping or reactive plume tracing, they rely on predefined coverage patterns, external infrastructure, or extensive sensing and coordination. In this work, we present a complete, open-source UAV system for online odor source localization using a minimal sensor suite. The system integrates custom olfaction hardware, onboard sensing, and a learning-based navigation policy trained in simulation and deployed on a real quadrotor. Through our minimal framework, the UAV is able to navigate directly toward an odor source without constructing an explicit gas distribution map or relying on external positioning systems. Vision is incorporated as an optional complementary modality to accelerate navigation under certain conditions. We validate the proposed system through real-world flight experiments in a large indoor environment using an ethanol source, demonstrating consistent source-finding behavior under realistic airflow conditions. The primary contribution of this work is a reproducible system and methodological framework for UAV-based olfactory navigation and source finding under minimal sensing assumptions. We elaborate on our hardware design and open source our UAV firmware, simulation code, olfaction-vision dataset, and circuit board to the community. Code, data, and designs will be made available at https://github.com/KordelFranceTech/ChasingGhosts.

Abstract: Learning-based methods commonly treat state estimation in robotics as a sequence modeling problem. While this paradigm can be effective at maximizing end-to-end performance, models are often difficult to interpret and expensive to train, since training requires unrolling sequences of predictions in time. As an alternative to end-to-end trained state estimation, we propose a novel particle filtering algorithm in which models are trained from individual state transitions, fully exploiting the Markov property in robotic systems. In this framework, measurement models are learned implicitly by minimizing a denoising score matching objective. At inference, the learned denoiser is used alongside a (learned) dynamics model to approximately solve the Bayesian filtering equation at each time step, effectively guiding predicted states toward the data manifold informed by measurements. We evaluate the proposed method on challenging robotic state estimation tasks in simulation, demonstrating competitive performance compared to tuned end-to-end trained baselines. Importantly, our method offers the desirable composability of classical filtering algorithms, allowing prior information and external sensor models to be incorporated without retraining.

Abstract: Distributed Manipulator Systems, composed of arrays of robotic actuators necessitate dense actuator arrays to effectively manipulate small objects. This paper presents a system composed of modular 3-DoF robotic tiles interconnected by a compliant surface layer, forming a continuous, controllable manipulation surface.

We characterize the coupled workspace of the array and develop a manipulation strategy capable of translating objects to arbitrary positions within an N X N array. The approach is validated experimentally using a minimal 2 X 2 prototype, demonstrating the successful manipulation of objects with varied shapes and sizes.

TL;DR: CACTO-BIC改进轨迹优化与强化学习结合方法，通过偏置初始状态采样和GPU加速，提升数据效率和计算速度，适用于高维系统实时应用


<details>

Motivation: 轨迹优化(TO)和强化学习(RL)在解决最优控制问题中各具优势：TO能高效计算局部最优解但难以处理非凸问题，RL对非凸问题更鲁棒但计算成本高。现有的CACTO方法结合两者优势，但面临可扩展性限制，系统复杂度增加时TO计算成本显著上升。

Result: 实验评估显示：相比CACTO，CACTO-BIC在样本效率和计算速度上均有提升；与PPO相比，能在更短时间内获得相似解；在AlienGO四足机器人上的实验证明该方法可扩展到高维系统，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: CACTO-BIC通过改进初始状态采样策略和利用GPU加速，有效解决了CACTO的可扩展性限制，实现了更高的数据效率和更快的计算速度，能够扩展到高维机器人系统并适用于实时控制应用。

Abstract: Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) offer complementary strengths for solving optimal control problems. TO efficiently computes locally optimal solutions but can struggle with non-convexity, while RL is more robust to non-convexity at the cost of significantly higher computational demands. CACTO (Continuous Actor-Critic with Trajectory Optimization) was introduced to combine these advantages by learning a warm-start policy that guides the TO solver towards low-cost trajectories. However, scalability remains a key limitation, as increasing system complexity significantly raises the computational cost of TO. This work introduces CACTO-BIC to address these challenges. CACTO-BIC improves data efficiency by biasing initial-state sampling leveraging a property of the value function associated with locally optimal policies; moreover, it reduces computation time by exploiting GPU acceleration. Empirical evaluations show improved sample efficiency and faster computation compared to CACTO. Comparisons with PPO demonstrate that our approach can achieve similar solutions in less time. Finally, experiments on the AlienGO quadruped robot demonstrate that CACTO-BIC can scale to high-dimensional systems and is suitable for real-time applications.

Abstract: Realizing dexterous embodied manipulation necessitates the deep integration of heterogeneous multimodal sensory inputs. However, current vision-centric paradigms often overlook the critical force and geometric feedback essential for complex tasks. This paper presents DeMUSE, a Deep Multimodal Unified Sparse Experts framework leveraging a Diffusion Transformer to integrate RGB, depth, and 6-axis force into a unified serialized stream. Adaptive Modality-specific Normalization (AdaMN) is employed to recalibrate modality-aware features, mitigating representation imbalance and harmonizing the heterogeneous distributions of multi-sensory signals. To facilitate efficient scaling, the architecture utilizes a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with shared experts, increasing model capacity for physical priors while maintaining the low inference latency required for real-time control. A Joint denoising objective synchronously synthesizes environmental evolution and action sequences to ensure physical consistency. Achieving success rates of 83.2% and 72.5% in simulation and real-world trials, DeMUSE demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, validating the necessity of deep multi-sensory integration for complex physical interactions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的3D接触估计模型严重依赖训练数据集，限制了其在复杂场景（如多点感知）中的泛化能力。实时预测高度柔性软材料的变形仍然是软体机器人领域的重大挑战。

Method: 提出TactiVerse框架，采用U-Net架构将接触几何估计转化为空间热图预测任务。该方法即使仅使用单点压痕的有限数据集进行训练，也能实现准确的单点感知。通过增加多点接触数据来增强训练数据集，显著提升了传感器的多点感知能力。

Result: 在单点感知方面，TactiVerse实现了0.0589 mm的平均绝对误差，优于传统基于回归的CNN基线的0.0612 mm。在两点辨别方面，通过增加多点接触数据训练，整体平均MAE从1.214 mm显著提升到0.383 mm。

Conclusion: 该方法通过从基本相互作用中成功推断复杂接触几何，实现了先进的多点和大面积形状感知，显著简化了基于标记的软传感器的开发，为现实世界的触觉感知提供了高度可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time prediction of deformation in highly compliant soft materials remains a significant challenge in soft robotics. While vision-based soft tactile sensors can track internal marker displacements, learning-based models for 3D contact estimation heavily depend on their training datasets, inherently limiting their ability to generalize to complex scenarios such as multi-point sensing. To address this limitation, we introduce TactiVerse, a U-Net-based framework that formulates contact geometry estimation as a spatial heatmap prediction task. Even when trained exclusively on a limited dataset of single-point indentations, our architecture achieves highly accurate single-point sensing, yielding a superior mean absolute error of 0.0589 mm compared to the 0.0612 mm of a conventional regression-based CNN baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting the training dataset with multi-point contact data substantially enhances the sensor's multi-point sensing capabilities, significantly improving the overall mean MAE for two-point discrimination from 1.214 mm to 0.383 mm. By successfully extrapolating complex contact geometries from fundamental interactions, this methodology unlocks advanced multi-point and large-area shape sensing. Ultimately, it significantly streamlines the development of marker-based soft sensors, offering a highly scalable solution for real-world tactile perception.

Abstract: In disaster response and situation assessment, robots have great potential in reducing the risks to the safety and health of first responders. As the situations encountered and the required capabilities of the robots deployed in such missions differ wildly and are often not known in advance, heterogeneous fleets of robots are needed to cover a wide range of mission requirements. While UAVs can quickly survey the mission environment, their ability to carry heavy payloads such as sensors and manipulators is limited. UGVs can carry required payloads to assess and manipulate the mission environment, but need to be able to deal with difficult and unstructured terrain such as rubble and stairs. The ability of tracked platforms with articulated arms (flippers) to reconfigure their geometry makes them particularly effective for navigating challenging terrain. In this paper, we present Athena, an open-hardware rescue ground robot research platform with four individually reconfigurable flippers and a reliable low-cost remote emergency stop (E-Stop) solution. A novel mounting solution using an industrial PU belt and tooth inserts allows the replacement and testing of different track profiles. The manipulator with a maximum reach of 1.54m can be used to operate doors, valves, and other objects of interest. Full CAD & PCB files, as well as all low-level software, are released as open-source contributions.

Abstract: Data-driven neural Koopman operator theory has emerged as a powerful tool for linearizing and controlling nonlinear robotic systems. However, the performance of these data-driven models fundamentally depends on the trade-off between sample size and model dimensions, a relationship for which the scaling laws have remained unclear. This paper establishes a rigorous framework to address this challenge by deriving and empirically validating scaling laws that connect sample size, latent space dimension, and downstream control quality. We derive a theoretical upper bound on the Koopman approximation error, explicitly decomposing it into sampling error and projection error. We show that these terms decay at specific rates relative to dataset size and latent dimension, providing a rigorous basis for the scaling law. Based on the theoretical results, we introduce two lightweight regularizers for the neural Koopman operator: a covariance loss to help stabilize the learned latent features and an inverse control loss to ensure the model aligns with physical actuation. The results from systematic experiments across six robotic environments confirm that model fitting error follows the derived scaling laws, and the regularizers improve dynamic model fitting fidelity, with enhanced closed-loop control performance. Together, our results provide a simple recipe for allocating effort between data collection and model capacity when learning Koopman dynamics for control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全方法在用户指定的上下文中强制执行固定约束，无法处理现实世界部署中开放式的上下文变异性。机器人越来越多地在开放世界环境中运行，安全行为取决于上下文（如拥挤与空旷的走廊、紧急情况与正常操作），需要能够在线进行上下文推理的安全框架

Result: CORE在未见过的环境中强制执行上下文适当的行为，显著优于缺乏在线上下文推理的先前语义安全方法。消融研究验证了理论保证，并强调了VLM推理和空间定位对于在新型环境中强制执行上下文安全的重要性

Conclusion: CORE框架通过在线上下文推理、定位和执行，解决了开放世界环境中机器人安全行为的上下文变异性问题，提供了考虑感知不确定性的概率安全保证，为机器人安全部署提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Robots are increasingly operating in open-world environments where safe behavior depends on context: the same hallway may require different navigation strategies when crowded versus empty, or during an emergency versus normal operations. Traditional safety approaches enforce fixed constraints in user-specified contexts, limiting their ability to handle the open-ended contextual variability of real-world deployment. We address this gap via CORE, a safety framework that enables online contextual reasoning, grounding, and enforcement without prior knowledge of the environment (e.g., maps or safety specifications). CORE uses a vision-language model (VLM) to continuously reason about context-dependent safety rules directly from visual observations, grounds these rules in the physical environment, and enforces the resulting spatially-defined safe sets via control barrier functions. We provide probabilistic safety guarantees for CORE that account for perceptual uncertainty, and we demonstrate through simulation and real-world experiments that CORE enforces contextually appropriate behavior in unseen environments, significantly outperforming prior semantic safety methods that lack online contextual reasoning. Ablation studies validate our theoretical guarantees and underscore the importance of both VLM-based reasoning and spatial grounding for enforcing contextual safety in novel settings.

Abstract: This work assesses the hydrodynamic efficiency of Underwater Unmanned Vehicles (UUVs) equipped with soft morphing wings compared to conventional rigid wings. Unlike rigid wings, deformable counterparts can alter their aerodynamic properties on demand. Improvements in hydrodynamic efficiency extend a UUV's operational range and may determine mission feasibility. Structural and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted for both a soft morphing wing and a UUV incorporating it. The results show that a UUV employing soft wings achieves 9.75 percent higher overall efficiency than an equivalent vehicle with traditional rigid wings. These findings confirm the potential of soft robotics to enhance underwater vehicle performance, particularly in applications requiring pressure-agnostic operation.

Abstract: Visual navigation typically assumes the existence of at least one obstacle-free path between start and goal, which must be discovered/planned by the robot. However, in real-world scenarios, such as home environments and warehouses, clutter can block all routes. Targeted at such cases, we introduce the Lifelong Interactive Navigation problem, where a mobile robot with manipulation abilities can move clutter to forge its own path to complete sequential object- placement tasks - each involving placing an given object (eg. Alarm clock, Pillow) onto a target object (eg. Dining table, Desk, Bed). To address this lifelong setting - where effects of environment changes accumulate and have long-term effects - we propose an LLM-driven, constraint-based planning framework with active perception. Our framework allows the LLM to reason over a structured scene graph of discovered objects and obstacles, deciding which object to move, where to place it, and where to look next to discover task-relevant information. This coupling of reasoning and active perception allows the agent to explore the regions expected to contribute to task completion rather than exhaustively mapping the environment. A standard motion planner then executes the corresponding navigate-pick-place, or detour sequence, ensuring reliable low-level control. Evaluated in physics-enabled ProcTHOR-10k simulator, our approach outperforms non-learning and learning-based baselines. We further demonstrate our approach qualitatively on real-world hardware.

Abstract: Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. Effective robotic manipulation requires policies that can anticipate physical outcomes and adapt to real-world environments. In this work, we introduce a unified framework, World-Model-Driven Diffusion Policy with Online Adaptive Learning (AdaWorldPolicy) to enhance robotic manipulation under dynamic conditions with minimal human involvement. Our core insight is that world models provide strong supervision signals, enabling online adaptive learning in dynamic environments, which can be complemented by force-torque feedback to mitigate dynamic force shifts. Our AdaWorldPolicy integrates a world model, an action expert, and a force predictor-all implemented as interconnected Flow Matching Diffusion Transformers (DiT). They are interconnected via the multi-modal self-attention layers, enabling deep feature exchange for joint learning while preserving their distinct modularity characteristics. We further propose a novel Online Adaptive Learning (AdaOL) strategy that dynamically switches between an Action Generation mode and a Future Imagination mode to drive reactive updates across all three modules. This creates a powerful closed-loop mechanism that adapts to both visual and physical domain shifts with minimal overhead. Across a suite of simulated and real-robot benchmarks, our AdaWorldPolicy achieves state-of-the-art performance, with dynamical adaptive capacity to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Solving long-horizon tasks requires robots to integrate high-level semantic reasoning with low-level physical interaction. While vision-language models (VLMs) and video generation models can decompose tasks and imagine outcomes, they often lack the physical grounding necessary for real-world execution. We introduce NovaPlan, a hierarchical framework that unifies closed-loop VLM and video planning with geometrically grounded robot execution for zero-shot long-horizon manipulation. At the high level, a VLM planner decomposes tasks into sub-goals and monitors robot execution in a closed loop, enabling the system to recover from single-step failures through autonomous re-planning. To compute low-level robot actions, we extract and utilize both task-relevant object keypoints and human hand poses as kinematic priors from the generated videos, and employ a switching mechanism to choose the better one as a reference for robot actions, maintaining stable execution even under heavy occlusion or depth inaccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NovaPlan on three long-horizon tasks and the Functional Manipulation Benchmark (FMB). Our results show that NovaPlan can perform complex assembly tasks and exhibit dexterous error recovery behaviors without any prior demonstrations or training.

Abstract: Estimating simulation-ready scenes from real-world observations is crucial for downstream planning and policy learning tasks. Regretfully, existing methods struggle in cluttered environments, often exhibiting prohibitive computational cost, poor robustness, and restricted generality when scaling to multiple interacting objects. We propose a unified optimization-based formulation for real-to-sim scene estimation that jointly recovers the shapes and poses of multiple rigid objects under physical constraints. Our method is built on two key technical innovations. First, we leverage the recently introduced shape-differentiable contact model, whose global differentiability permits joint optimization over object geometry and pose while modeling inter-object contacts. Second, we exploit the structured sparsity of the augmented Lagrangian Hessian to derive an efficient linear system solver whose computational cost scales favorably with scene complexity. Building on this formulation, we develop an end-to-end real-to-sim scene estimation pipeline that integrates learning-based object initialization, physics-constrained joint shape-pose optimization, and differentiable texture refinement. Experiments on cluttered scenes with up to 5 objects and 22 convex hulls demonstrate that our approach robustly reconstructs physically valid, simulation-ready object shapes and poses.
